ORRRn this side Jordan , in the valley over against Beth-peor , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smote , after they were come forth out of Egypt :
To the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . And who is sufficient for these things ?
For we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
Now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ , in them that are saved , and in them that perish :
Furthermore , when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord ,
I had no rest in my spirit , because I found not Titus my brother : but taking my leave of them , I went from thence into Macedonia .
To whom ye forgive any thing , I forgive also : for if I forgave any thing , to whom I forgave it , for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ ;
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us : for we are not ignorant of his devices .
And a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks , and herds , even very much cattle .
And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leavened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
And Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
And he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , Rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ; and go , serve the LORD , as ye have said .
Also take your flocks and your herds , as ye have said , and be gone ; and bless me also .
And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , We be all dead men .
And the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment :
And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they lent unto them such things as they required . And they spoiled the Egyptians .
And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
It is a trespass offering : he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD .
And what he did unto the army of Egypt , unto their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day ;
And Isaac gave up the ghost , and died , and was gathered unto his people , being old and full of days : and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .
And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years .
The sons of Leah ; Reuben , Jacob's firstborn , and Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Zebulun :
And it came to pass , when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine : and Israel heard it . Now the sons of Jacob were twelve :
And Israel journeyed , and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar .
And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave : that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day .
And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre , unto the city of Arbah , which is Hebron , where Abraham and Isaac sojourned .
And the sons of Zilpah , Leah's handmaid ; Gad , and Asher : these are the sons of Jacob , which were born to him in Padan-aram .
And the sons of Bilhah , Rachel's handmaid ; Dan , and Naphtali :
The sons of Rachel ; Joseph , and Benjamin :
He answered and said , I will not : but afterward he repented , and went .
But what think ye ? A certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go work to day in my vineyard .
And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree , but also if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done .
And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered away !
And they answered Jesus , and said , We cannot tell . And he said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
But if we shall say , Of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold John as a prophet .
The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward .
And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other .
And there were eight boards ; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver , under every board two sockets .
And he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
And all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
For I say unto you , Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
And he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
And he made a vail of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : with cherubims made he it of cunning work .
But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings' courts .
And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
This is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
When the men were come unto him , they said , John Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
And blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
Then Jesus answering said unto them , Go your way , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the gospel is preached .
These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness , in the plain over against the Red sea , between Paran , and Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb , saying , Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount :
And the land be subdued before the LORD : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the LORD , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD .
And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the congregation .
And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him , that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient .
And he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
And Moses did as the LORD commanded him : and he took Joshua , and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the congregation :
But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned .
On this side Jordan , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law , saying ,
And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings .
From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
This I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
That we henceforth be no more children , tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the sleight of men , and cunning craftiness , whereby they lie in wait to deceive ;
But speaking the truth in love , may grow up into him in all things , which is the head , even Christ :
For the perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the edifying of the body of Christ :
Till we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ :
He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens , that he might fill all things . )
Father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; the fat thereof , and the whole rump , it shall he take off hard by the backbone ; and the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
Having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock ; male or female , he shall offer it without blemish .
If he offer a lamb for his offering , then shall he offer it before the LORD .
And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt , and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm : therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day .
And the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
And Judah said , What shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants : behold , we are my lord's servants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
And he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house ; for he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
And Joseph said unto them , What deed is this that ye have done ? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine ?
And he searched , and began at the eldest , and left at the youngest : and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack .
Then they rent their clothes , and laded every man his ass , and returned to the city .
Or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
Let love be without dissimulation . Abhor that which is evil ; cleave to that which is good .
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us , whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith ;
Or ministry , let us wait on our ministering : or he that teacheth , on teaching ;
For as we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office :
So we , being many , are one body in Christ , and every one members one of another .
And be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
For I say , through the grace given unto me , to every man that is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but to think soberly , according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith .
Then Judah came near unto him , and said , Oh my lord , let thy servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord's ears , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as Pharaoh .
I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
And when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
And entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them .
Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
When they were filled , he said unto his disciples , Gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost .
Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
And Jesus said , Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
And Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
For by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him :
And he is before all things , and by him all things consist .
In whom we have redemption through his blood , even the forgiveness of sins :
Who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of every creature :
Giving thanks unto the Father , which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light :
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son :
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
And if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
But I say unto you , That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples , and came into the parts of Dalmanutha .
And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have no bread .
And when Jesus knew it , he saith unto them , Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not yet , neither understand ? have ye your heart yet hardened ?
Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod .
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
For I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee ;
But I say unto you , That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
Agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
Leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not commit adultery :
Verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
Therefore thou shalt say unto them , When ye have heaved the best thereof from it , then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor , and as the increase of the winepress .
And ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households : for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation .
And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , when ye have heaved from it the best of it : neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel , lest ye die .
What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith , and have not works ? can faith save him ?
Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it unto you .
And when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They said unto him , Yea , Lord .
But when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
He said unto them , Give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . And they laughed him to scorn .
And when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou Son of David , have mercy on us .
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land .
For she said within herself , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole .
And , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
And when Jesus came into the ruler's house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
But Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And the woman was made whole from that hour .
By these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
For their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates .
And the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates of fire , and of jacinth , and brimstone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
And they had tails like unto scorpions , and there were stings in their tails : and their power was to hurt men five months .
And they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
One woe is past ; and , behold , there come two woes more hereafter .
And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
And it came to pass , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
And all the congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people wept that night .
And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land , to fall by the sword , that our wives and our children should be a prey ? were it not better for us to return into Egypt ?
And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness !
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
And they said one to another , Let us make a captain , and let us return into Egypt .
And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel , saying , The land , which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land .
And Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes :
Only rebel not ye against the LORD , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them , and the LORD is with us : fear them not .
If the LORD delight in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which floweth with milk and honey .
If a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
And this commandment have we from him , That he who loveth God love his brother also .
Then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before Paul and Silas ,
But Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , Do thyself no harm : for we are all here .
And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed , and sang praises unto God : and the prisoners heard them .
Who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled .
And suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one's bands were loosed .
And teach customs , which are not lawful for us to receive , neither to observe , being Romans .
And brought them to the magistrates , saying , These men , being Jews , do exceedingly trouble our city ,
And when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely :
And the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistrates rent off their clothes , and commanded to beat them .
And when we departed from Horeb , we went through all that great and terrible wilderness , which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites , as the LORD our God commanded us ; and we came to Kadesh-barnea .
And the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Girgashites , and the Jebusites .
And the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Rephaims ,
But because the LORD loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
Know therefore that the LORD thy God , he is God , the faithful God , which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ;
When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it , and hath cast out many nations before thee , the Hittites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , seven nations greater and mightier than thou ;
And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee ; thou shalt smite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them :
Whatsoever parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that shall ye eat .
For they will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
But thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their altars , and break down their images , and cut down their groves , and burn their graven images with fire .
For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God : the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
The LORD did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fewest of all people :
Thine eye shall not pity him , but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with thee .
And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God , ye , and your sons , and your daughters , and your menservants , and your maidservants , and the Levite that is within your gates ; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you .
Doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ?
Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them , )
They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet .
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth , and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
Behold , the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , crieth : and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth .
Be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . Behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
Ye have condemned and killed the just ; and he doth not resist you .
Go to now , ye rich men , weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you .
Your gold and silver is cankered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days .
Your riches are corrupted , and your garments are motheaten .
Grudge not one against another , brethren , lest ye be condemned : behold , the judge standeth before the door .
Be ye also patient ; stablish your hearts : for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh .
The aged women likewise , that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teachers of good things ;
That the aged men be sober , grave , temperate , sound in faith , in charity , in patience .
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine :
In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works : in doctrine shewing uncorruptness , gravity , sincerity ,
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded .
To be discreet , chaste , keepers at home , good , obedient to their own husbands , that the word of God be not blasphemed .
That they may teach the young women to be sober , to love their husbands , to love their children ,
Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters , and to please them well in all things ; not answering again ;
Sound speech , that cannot be condemned ; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed , having no evil thing to say of you .
The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand ; because the LORD was with him , and that which he did , the LORD made it to prosper .
And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
But the LORD was with Joseph , and shewed him mercy , and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
And Joseph's master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king's prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
And the LORD said , I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt , and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters ; for I know their sorrows ;
Moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . And Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
And he said , Draw not nigh hither : put off thy shoes from off thy feet , for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see , God called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , Moses , Moses . And he said , Here am I .
And he said unto him , I will not go ; but I will depart to mine own land , and to my kindred .
By faith he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house :
And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he looked , and , behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law , the priest of Midian : and he led the flock to the backside of the desert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Horeb .
And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do .
According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee :
And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour , or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand , ye shall not oppress one another :
Ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear thy God : for I am the LORD your God .
According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof , and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it : for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee .
A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed .
And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession .
For it is the jubile ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
And the land shall yield her fruit , and he shall eat your fill , and dwell therein in safety .
Wherefore ye shall do my statutes , and keep my judgments , and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices , and drank the wine of their drink offerings ? let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth .
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit :
By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ;
But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ;
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
Having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of evildoers , they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ .
For it is better , if the will of God be so , that ye suffer for well doing , than for evil doing .
For he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile :
Let him eschew evil , and do good ; let him seek peace , and ensue it .
For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous , and his ears are open unto their prayers : but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil .
And who is he that will harm you , if ye be followers of that which is good ?
Are we not counted of him strangers ? for he hath sold us , and hath quite devoured also our money .
And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness .
And these things , brethren , I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes ; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written , that no one of you be puffed up for one against another .
For who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
For I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that judgeth me is the Lord .
Therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts : and then shall every man have praise of God .
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus , who of God is made unto us wisdom , and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption :

And for the other side of the court gate , on this hand and that hand , were hangings of fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .

For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates :
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour's .

Thou shalt not commit adultery .
Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee , knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say .
A bell and a pomegranate , a bell and a pomegranate , round about the hem of the robe to minister in ; as the LORD commanded Moses .

Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
And many that believed came , and confessed , and shewed their deeds .

Jesus answered and said unto them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up .
And he spake unto the congregation , saying , Depart , I pray you , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consumed in all their sins .

For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you :
But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thine head , and wash thy face ;
Moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth and rust doth corrupt , and where thieves break through and steal :
That thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .

That ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also .

Greet Mary , who bestowed much labour on us .

At midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests ,
And I punished them oft in every synagogue , and compelled them to blaspheme ; and being exceedingly mad against them , I persecuted them even unto strange cities .

Delivering thee from the people , and from the Gentiles , unto whom now I send thee ,
But rise , and stand upon thy feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;

But I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
Now if I do that I would not , it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
To open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins , and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me .

Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood : two cubits shall be the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .

For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;
That ye abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication : from which if ye keep yourselves , ye shall do well . Fare ye well .
Forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
It seemed good unto us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
We have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who shall also tell you the same things by mouth .

And to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .

But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you .
My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me :

And if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so ?
For if ye love them which love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ?
That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .

In the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it : it shall be holy unto thee .
And this is thine ; the heave offering of their gift , with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel : I have given them unto thee , and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee , by a statute for ever : every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it .
And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem , according to thine estimation , for the money of five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which is twenty gerahs .
But the firstling of a cow , or the firstling of a sheep , or the firstling of a goat , thou shalt not redeem ; they are holy : thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar , and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire , for a sweet savour unto the LORD .
Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine .
Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the LORD , whether it be of men or beasts , shall be thine : nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem , and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem .
And the flesh of them shall be thine , as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine .

Wherefore , if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend .
But when ye sin so against the brethren , and wound their weak conscience , ye sin against Christ .

And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time , saying ,

Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius ; and said , Behold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
Arise therefore , and get thee down , and go with them , doubting nothing : for I have sent them .
And as he talked with him , he went in , and found many that were come together .
But Peter took him up , saying , Stand up ; I myself also am a man .

Then asked they him , What man is that which said unto thee , Take up thy bed , and walk ?
He answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk .

But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto , and I work .
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day .

And this shall be your north border : from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor :
And as for the western border , ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your west border .
And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass on to Zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea , and shall go on to Hazar-addar , and pass on to Azmon :
Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house , lest thou be a cursed thing like it : but thou shalt utterly detest it , and thou shalt utterly abhor it ; for it is a cursed thing .
And the border shall go on to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar-enan : this shall be your north border .
From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad :
And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little : thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee .

And Joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him : and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
And it came to pass after these things , that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph ; and she said , Lie with me .
And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand ; and he knew not ought he had , save the bread which he did eat . And Joseph was a goodly person , and well favoured .
And Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites , which had brought him down thither .
And his master saw that the LORD was with him , and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
And the LORD was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
There is none greater in this house than I ; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee , because thou art his wife : how then can I do this great wickedness , and sin against God ?

But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ?
And Jesus answering said unto them , They that are whole need not a physician ; but they that are sick .
I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
And they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
But new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .

And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother , and his sons with him , from among the children of Israel , that he may minister unto me in the priest's office , even Aaron , Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar , Aaron's sons .
And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty .
And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted , whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom , that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him , that he may minister unto me in the priest's office .
And these are the garments which they shall make ; a breastplate , and an ephod , and a robe , and a broidered coat , a mitre , and a girdle : and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother , and his sons , that he may minister unto me in the priest's office .
And they shall take gold , and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen .
And they shall make the ephod of gold , of blue , and of purple , of scarlet , and fine twined linen , with cunning work .
It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof ; and so it shall be joined together .
And the curious girdle of the ephod , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
And thou shalt take two onyx stones , and grave on them the names of the children of Israel :
As unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and , behold , we live ; as chastened , and not killed ;
By honour and dishonour , by evil report and good report : as deceivers , and yet true ;
In stripes , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ;
But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God , in much patience , in afflictions , in necessities , in distresses ,
By the word of truth , by the power of God , by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ,
By pureness , by knowledge , by longsuffering , by kindness , by the Holy Ghost , by love unfeigned ,
We then , as workers together with him , beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain .
Giving no offence in any thing , that the ministry be not blamed :
( For he saith , I have heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee : behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation . )

A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump .
This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you .
For I testify again to every man that is circumcised , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
Behold , I Paul say unto you , that if ye be circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
Ye did run well ; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth ?
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision ; but faith which worketh by love .
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith .
Christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
The land shall not be sold for ever : for the land is mine ; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
And they returned , and prepared spices and ointments ; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment .
And that day was the preparation , and the sabbath drew on .

And , behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counseller ; and he was a good man , and a just :

I said , I would scatter them into corners , I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men :

Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes , I considered , and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
And I heard a voice saying unto me , Arise , Peter ; slay and eat .
But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning , and expounded it by order unto them , saying ,
I was in the city of Joppa praying : and in a trance I saw a vision , A certain vessel descend , as it had been a great sheet , let down from heaven by four corners ; and it came even to me :
And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem , they that were of the circumcision contended with him ,
Saying , Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised , and didst eat with them .
And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
But I said , Not so , Lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth .
But the voice answered me again from heaven , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father's which sent me .
These things have I spoken unto you , being yet present with you .
But the Comforter , which is the Holy Ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you .
Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
Judas saith unto him , not Iscariot , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again unto you . If ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go unto the Father : for my Father is greater than I .
And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
For it is written , I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent .
Now this I say , that every one of you saith , I am of Paul ; and I of Apollos ; and I of Cephas ; and I of Christ .
Is Christ divided ? was Paul crucified for you ? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul ?
Now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
For it hath been declared unto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
And I baptized also the household of Stephanas : besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel : not with wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect .
I thank God that I baptized none of you , but Crispus and Gaius ;
Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name .
If thou wilt send our brother with us , we will go down and buy thee food :
But if thou wilt not send him , we will not go down : for the man said unto us , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
And Israel said , Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me , as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother ?
And they said , The man asked us straitly of our state , and of our kindred , saying , Is your father yet alive ? have ye another brother ? and we told him according to the tenor of these words : could we certainly know that he would say , Bring your brother down ?
And the famine was sore in the land .
And it came to pass , when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said unto them , Go again , buy us a little food .
And Judah spake unto him , saying , The man did solemnly protest unto us , saying , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .

I will be surety for him ; of my hand shalt thou require him : if I bring him not unto thee , and set him before thee , then let me bear the blame for ever :
In him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not .
There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
The same was in the beginning with God .
All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
Remember , and forget not , how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt , until ye came unto this place , ye have been rebellious against the LORD .
He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
Then came together unto him the Pharisees , and certain of the scribes , which came from Jerusalem .
And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
And when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . And many other things there be , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , brasen vessels , and of tables .
Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashen hands ?
He answered and said unto them , Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
Howbeit in vain do they worship me , teaching for doctines the commandments of men .
For laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
And he said unto them , Full well ye reject the commandment of God , that ye may keep your own tradition .
And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners ?
And he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come .
Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness , wherein were fiery serpents , and scorpions , and drought , where there was no water ; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint ;
And he said unto them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer :
And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves :
For I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
And he said unto them , Behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in .
And they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
And look that thou make them after their pattern , which was shewed thee in the mount .
For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you , to fight for you agginst your enemies , to save you .
And they removed from Alush , and encamped at Rephidim , where was no water for the people to drink .
But go ye and learn what that meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
And Joseph said unto his father , They are my sons , whom God hath given me in this place . And he said , Bring them , I pray thee , unto me , and I will bless them .
And Israel beheld Joseph's sons , and said , Who are these ?
And when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
And when he had thus spoken , the king rose up , and the governor , and Bernice , and they that sat with them :

And the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdom of Og , gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , with all Bashan , which was called the land of giants .
And this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and half mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon ? nine cubits was the length thereof , and four cubits the breadth of it , after the cubit of a man .
All the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , unto Salchah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
And Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
And the LORD said unto Moses , When thou goest to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh , which I have put in thine hand : but I will harden his heart , that he shall not let the people go .

When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you , then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
Now Korah , the son of Izhar , the son of Kohath , the son of Levi , and Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , and On , the son of Peleth , sons of Reuben , took men :
And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written , KING OF KINGS , AND LORD OF LORDS .
Whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthy lucre's sake .
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers , specially they of the circumcision :
This witness is true . Wherefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ;
One of themselves , even a prophet of their own , said , The Cretians are alway liars , evil beasts , slow bellies .
Unto the pure all things are pure : but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure ; but even their mind and conscience is defiled .
Not giving heed to Jewish fables , and commandments of men , that turn from the truth .
They profess that they know God ; but in works they deny him , being abominable , and disobedient , and unto every good work reprobate .
And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
He went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except I drink it , thy will be done .
And he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy .
And he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
Then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
Rise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that doth betray me .
And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
And forthwith he came to Jesus , and said , Hail , master ; and kissed him .
Being forty days tempted of the devil . And in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
And the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
For neither at any time used we flattering words , as ye know , nor a cloke of covetousness ; God is witness :
And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness ,

For ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail : for labouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of God .
So being affectionately desirous of you , we were willing to have imparted unto you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
I call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
This do ; Take you censers , Korah , and all his company ;
For this commandment which I command thee this day , it is not hidden from thee , neither is it far off .
If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
Neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
It is not in heaven , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
See , I have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ;
But the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
But if thine heart turn away , so that thou wilt not hear , but shalt be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God , to walk in his ways , and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments , that thou mayest live and multiply : and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar : it is a burnt offering unto the LORD : it is a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
And thou shalt take the other ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed , and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation , beside that that his hand shall get : according to the vow which he vowed , so he must do after the law of his separation .
And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock .
And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD , by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock , and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger , and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar .
And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul that is above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and burn them upon the altar .
But the flesh of the bullock , and his skin , and his dung , shalt thou burn with fire without the camp : it is a sin offering .
Thou shalt also take one ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
And thou shalt slay the ram , and thou shalt take his blood , and sprinkle it round about upon the altar .
And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces , and wash the inwards of him , and his legs , and put them unto his pieces , and unto his head .
The LORD bless thee , and keep thee :
And if Christ be not raised , your faith is vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
For if the dead rise not , then is not Christ raised :
Yea , and we are found false witnesses of God ; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ : whom he raised not up , if so be that the dead rise not .
And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long , and waxed louder and louder , Moses spake , and God answered him by a voice .
And if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
There shall not an hand touch it , but he shall surely be stoned , or shot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount .
But if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is Christ not risen :
And be ready against the third day : for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Go unto the people , and sanctify them to day and to morrow , and let them wash their clothes ,
And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God ; and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
And it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled .
And he said unto the people , Be ready against the third day : come not at your wives .
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you , and for them at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ;
That their hearts might be comforted , being knit together in love , and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding , to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God , and of the Father , and of Christ ;
In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
And this I say , lest any man should beguile you with enticing words .
Therefore whether it were I or they , so we preach , and so ye believed .
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk ye in him :
Rooted and built up in him , and stablished in the faith , as ye have been taught , abounding therein with thanksgiving .
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the rudiments of the world , and not after Christ .
For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily .
But by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I laboured more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
If others be partakers of this power over you , are not we rather ? Nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ .
Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple ? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter ?
Or saith he it altogether for our sakes ? For our sakes , no doubt , this is written : that he that ploweth should plow in hope ; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope .
If we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things ?
For though I preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon me ; yea , woe is unto me , if I preach not the gospel !
For if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me .
Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel .
But I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD , which is in the tabernacle of the congregation : and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering , which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood , and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD , before the vail of the sanctuary .
What is my reward then ? Verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
For though I be free from all men , yet have I made myself servant unto all , that I might gain the more .
If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering .
Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them :
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And unto Aaron was born Nadab , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
And the child grew , and was weaned : and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned .
So then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman , but of the free .
Nevertheless what saith the scripture ? Cast out the bondwoman and her son : for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman .
Which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of Christ .
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
To whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
Who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil world , according to the will of God and our Father :
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father , and from our Lord Jesus Christ ,
If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most miserable .
Paul , an apostle , ( not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ; )
But when he saw Jesus afar off , he ran and worshipped him ,
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished .
As we said before , so say I now again , If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received , let him be accursed .
But though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed .
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , which she had born unto Abraham , mocking .
Neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
And the man , the lord of the country , said unto us , Hereby shall I know that ye are true men ; leave one of your brethren here with me , and take food for the famine of your households , and be gone :
And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust .
The man , who is the lord of the land , spake roughly to us , and took us for spies of the country .
Have all the gifts of healing ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
But covet earnestly the best gifts : and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way .
And we said unto him , We are true men ; we are no spies :
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar , and Ahuzzath one of his friends , and Phichol the chief captain of his army .
And Jacob their father said unto them , Me have ye bereaved of my children : Joseph is not , and Simeon is not , and ye will take Benjamin away : all these things are against me .
And I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest . And he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
And Reuben spake unto his father , saying , Slay my two sons , if I bring him not to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again .
And there were voices , and thunders , and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
And the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
And bring your youngest brother unto me : then shall I know that ye are no spies , but that ye are true men : so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffick in the land .
And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores , and repented not of their deeds .
And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
For they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
Behold , I come as a thief . Blessed is he that watcheth , and keepeth his garments , lest he walk naked , and they see his shame .
And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon .
And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , It is done .
And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen , saying , The water is ours : and he called the name of the well Esek ; because they strove with him .
For meat destroy not the work of God . All things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .

And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter .
And when there had been much disputing , Peter rose up , and said unto them , Men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us , that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
And when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed , saying , That it was needful to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of Moses .
And God , which knoweth the hearts , bare them witness , giving them the Holy Ghost , even as he did unto us ;
And put no difference between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
And he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
And Philip ran thither to him , and heard him read the prophet Esaias , and said , Understandest thou what thou readest ?
In his humiliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth .
The place of the scripture which he read was this , He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth :
Then Philip opened his mouth , and began at the same scripture , and preached unto him Jesus .
And the eunuch answered Philip , and said , I pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
And Philip said , If thou believest with all thine heart , thou mayest . And he answered and said , I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God .
And as they went on their way , they came unto a certain water : and the eunuch said , See , here is water ; what doth hinder me to be baptized ?
And when they were come up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip , that the eunuch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoicing .
And he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both Philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
And Sarai said unto Abram , Behold now , the LORD hath restrained me from bearing : I pray thee , go in unto my maid ; it may be that I may obtain children by her . And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai .
And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife .
Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children : and she had an handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
But Abram said unto Sarai , Behold , thy maid is in thy hand ; do to her as it pleaseth thee . And when Sarai dealt hardly with her , she fled from her face .
And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
This parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
Then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
And when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood , wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him .
As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
And if it be on her bed , or on any thing whereon she sitteth , when he toucheth it , he shall be unclean until the even .
And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
This is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever .
These things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean , and shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation : and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean , as the uncleanness of her separation .

And from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
And he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
And he saith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? But they held their peace .

And the Pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea ,
And he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand , Stand forth .
If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
And there are three that bear witness in earth , the spirit , and the water , and the blood : and these three agree in one .
For there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
This is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is truth .
Who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God ?
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith .
For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God , and keep his commandments .

Who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? Let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you : they shall not be eaten .
And the stork , and the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius , a centurion of the band called the Italian band ,
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them , and he served them : and they continued a season in ward .
He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him , and saying unto him , Cornelius .
A devout man , and one that feared God with all his house , which gave much alms to the people , and prayed to God alway .
And now send men to Joppa , and call for one Simon , whose surname is Peter :
And when he looked on him , he was afraid , and said , What is it , Lord ? And he said unto him , Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God .
And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner , whose house is by the sea side : he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do .
On the morrow , as they went on their journey , and drew nigh unto the city , Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :

And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;

And the LORD said unto Moses , Go , get thee down ; for thy people , which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt , have corrupted themselves :
And said , My Lord , if now I have found favour in thy sight , pass not away , I pray thee , from thy servant :
Now therefore hearken , O Israel , unto the statutes and unto the judgments , which I teach you , for to do them , that ye may live , and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you .
On the morrow , because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews , he loosed him from his bands , and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear , and brought Paul down , and set him before them .
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea , very much , until he left numbering ; for it was without number .
Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command thee this day .

And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
Again , he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
But they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , another to his merchandise :
And the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them .
But when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
Then saith he to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy .
Go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage .
And Enoch lived sixty and five years , and begat Methuselah :
The owner of the pit shall make it good , and give money unto the owner of them ; and the dead beast shall be his .
And if one man's ox hurt another's , that he die ; then they shall sell the live ox , and divide the money of it ; and the dead ox also they shall divide .
If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
And if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit , and not cover it , and an ox or an ass fall therein ;
If there be laid on him a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
Whether he have gored a son , or have gored a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
For we write none other things unto you , than what ye read or acknowledge ; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end ;
For our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you-ward .
Ye also helping together by prayer for us , that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
Who delivered us from so great a death , and doth deliver : in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ;
When I therefore was thus minded , did I use lightness ? or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be yea yea , and nay nay ?
And to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea .
And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before , that ye might have a second benefit ;
As also ye have acknowledged us in part , that we are your rejoicing , even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus .
And they departed from Rephidim , and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai .
And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years , and begat sons and daughters :
For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus , was not yea and nay , but in him was yea .
But as God is true , our word toward you was not yea and nay .
And gave them for the potter's field , as the Lord appointed me .
And they removed from Elim , and encamped by the Red sea .
And they departed from Dophkah , and encamped in Alush .
And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin , and encamped in Dophkah .
And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him , with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast , and them that worshipped his image . These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone .
And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse , which sword proceeded out of his mouth : and all the fowls were filled with their flesh .
And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years :
After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision , saying , Fear not , Abram : I am thy shield , and thy exceeding great reward .
Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam ; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee , because the LORD thy God loved thee .
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them , he was received up into heaven , and sat on the right hand of God .
They shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
And they , when they had heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , believed not .
And she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
And they went and told it unto the residue : neither believed they them .
After that he appeared in another form unto two of them , as they walked , and went into the country .
And he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
And these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned .
And then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
And the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken .
But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
But take ye heed : behold , I have foretold you all things .
For false Christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
Then said Pilate unto him , Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
And except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
And thou shalt take the Levites for me ( I am the LORD ) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel ; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward , and take the number of their names .
And all the firstborn males by the number of names , from a month old and upward , of those that were numbered of them , were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen .
And Moses numbered , as the LORD commanded him , all the firstborn among the children of Israel .
Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel , and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle ; and the Levites shall be mine : I am the LORD .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar .
Whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , shall even be cut off from his people .
For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
Then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed .
And he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
So they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
And the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie ,
The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother , and his sons with him ; and shalt anoint them , and consecrate them , and sanctify them , that they may minister unto me in the priest's office .
Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
Then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
And Pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him .
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
I will therefore chastise him , and release him .
( For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast . )
Said unto them , Ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverteth the people : and , behold , I , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him :
No , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
And they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas :
( Who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . )
And he made the laver of brass , and the foot of it of brass , of the lookingglasses of the women assembling , which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack's mouth .
And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses , the tent , and all his furniture , his taches , his boards , his bars , and his pillars , and his sockets ,
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
And Abimelech said unto Abraham , What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves ?
And Abimelech said , I wot not who hath done this thing : neither didst thou tell me , neither yet heard I of it , but to day .
And Abraham took sheep and oxen , and gave them unto Abimelech ; and both of them made a covenant .
And Abraham said , I will swear .
And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water , which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away .
And it came to pass at that time , that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that thou doest :
Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me , nor with my son , nor with my son's son : but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee , thou shalt do unto me , and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned .
And God was with the lad ; and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became an archer .
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , HOLINESS TO THE LORD .
The pure candlestick , with the lamps thereof , even with the lamps to be set in order , and all the vessels thereof , and the oil for light ,
The table , and all the vessels thereof , and the shewbread ,
Thou art to pass over through Ar , the coast of Moab , this day :
The ark of the testimony , and the staves thereof , and the mercy seat ,
And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and the altar , he shall bring the live goat :
And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea , until we were come over the brook Zered , was thirty and eight years ; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host , as the LORD sware unto them .
For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them , to destroy them from among the host , until they were consumed .
So it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
And the covering of rams' skins dyed red , and the covering of badgers' skins , and the vail of the covering ,
The Emims dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims ;
Which also were accounted giants , as the Anakims ; but the Moabites call them Emims .
The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime ; but the children of Esau succeeded them , when they had destroyed them from before them , and dwelt in their stead ; as Israel did unto the land of his possession , which the LORD gave unto them .
Now rise up , said I , and get you over the brook Zered . And we went over the brook Zered .
And the swan , and the pelican , and the gier eagle ,
And the stork , the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
For when ye were the servants of sin , ye were free from righteousness .
For the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
But now being made free from sin , and become servants to God , ye have your fruit unto holiness , and the end everlasting life .
And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent .
And he said unto him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rose from the dead .
And all that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you :
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
And the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind ,
And the little owl , and the cormorant , and the great owl ,
And the vulture , and the kite after his kind ;
Every raven after his kind ;
And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary , and all the vessels of the sanctuary , as the camp is to set forward ; after that , the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it : but they shall not touch any holy thing , lest they die . These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation .
Whosoever shall make like unto that , to smell thereto , shall even be cut off from his people .
And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof , wherewith they minister about it , even the censers , the fleshhooks , and the shovels , and the basons , all the vessels of the altar ; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins , and put to the staves of it .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
And the LORD said unto Moses , If her father had but spit in her face , should she not be ashamed seven days ? let her be shut out from the camp seven days , and after that let her be received in again .
And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days : and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again .
And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth , and pitched in the wilderness of Paran .
And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fryingpan , and in the pan , shall be the priest's that offereth it .
And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle ; and , behold , Miriam became leprous , white as snow : and Aaron looked upon Miriam , and , behold , she was leprous .
And Aaron said unto Moses , Alas , my lord , I beseech thee , lay not the sin upon us , wherein we have done foolishly , and wherein we have sinned .
Let her not be as one dead , of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb .
And Moses cried unto the LORD , saying , Heal her now , O God , I beseech thee .
And if the man like not to take his brother's wife , then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders , and say , My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel , he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother .
Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , Concerning the feasts of the LORD , which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations , even these are my feasts .
Ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
For of this sort are they which creep into houses , and lead captive silly women laden with sins , led away with divers lusts ,
Having a form of godliness , but denying the power thereof : from such turn away .
Traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ;
Without natural affection , trucebreakers , false accusers , incontinent , fierce , despisers of those that are good ,
For men shall be lovers of their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy ,
This know also , that in the last days perilous times shall come .
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself , saying , After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure , my lord being old also ?
And a girdle of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet , of needlework ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
For he said , Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation .
But they shall proceed no further : for their folly shall be manifest unto all men , as theirs also was .
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses , so do these also resist the truth : men of corrupt minds , reprobate concerning the faith .
( Now that he ascended , what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth ?
Then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand to it , and say , I like not to take her ;
Six days shall work be done : but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest , an holy convocation ; ye shall do no work therein : it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings .
Wherefore he saith , When he ascended up on high , he led captivity captive , and gave gifts unto men .
Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
But as for thee , stand thou here by me , and I will speak unto thee all the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it .
Go say to them , Get you into your tents again .
Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites :
Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders , and loose his shoe from off his foot , and spit in his face , and shall answer and say , So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house .
These are the feasts of the LORD , even holy convocations , which ye shall proclaim in their seasons .
For not he that commendeth himself is approved , but whom the Lord commendeth .
Not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other men's labours ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly ,
For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not unto you : for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ :
But he that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord .
To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you , and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand .
Let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are absent , such will we be also in deed when we are present .
For his letters , say they , are weighty and powerful ; but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech contemptible .
But we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
For we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover .
And Jethro said , Blessed be the LORD , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods : for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them .
And Jethro , Moses' father in law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God : and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God .
With all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , forbearing one another in love ;
And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , What is this thing that thou doest to the people ? why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
When they have a matter , they come unto me ; and I judge between one and another , and I do make them know the statutes of God , and his laws .
And Moses' father in law said unto him , The thing that thou doest is not good .
Thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
One Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers ;
There is one body , and one Spirit , even as ye are called in one hope of your calling ;
But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
One God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all .
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD : seven days ye must eat unleavened bread .
And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
And Moses gave the tribute , which was the LORD's heave offering , unto Eleazar the priest , as the LORD commanded Moses .
And this shall be a statute for ever unto you : that in the seventh month , on the tenth day of the month , ye shall afflict your souls , and do no work at all , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger that sojourneth among you :
In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
I do not frustrate the grace of God : for if righteousness come by the law , then Christ is dead in vain .
According to all that I shew thee , after the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all the instruments thereof , even so shall ye make it .
And let them make me a sanctuary ; that I may dwell among them .
Onyx stones , and stones to be set in the ephod , and in the breastplate .
And always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
And rams' skins dyed red , and badgers' skins , and shittim wood ,
And blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats' hair ,
And this is the offering which ye shall take of them ; gold , and silver , and brass ,
Speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring me an offering : of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
But when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
For this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people .
Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at meat .
And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished all these sayings , he said unto his disciples ,
Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover , and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
Then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
And , Whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it , he is guilty .
Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
Let all things be done decently and in order .
Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
Neither be ye called masters : for one is your Master , even Christ .
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
But woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte , and when he is made , ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves .
Woe unto you , ye blind guides , which say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor !
Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifieth the gold ?
To wit , that God was in Christ , reconciling the world unto himself , not imputing their trespasses unto them ; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation .
And all things are of God , who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ , and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
Therefore if any man be in Christ , he is a new creature : old things are passed away ; behold , all things are become new .
Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh : yea , though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now henceforth know we him no more .
And that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
For the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
For whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
For we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
And Abram took Sarai his wife , and Lot his brother's son , and all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls that they had gotten in Haran ; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan ; and into the land of Canaan they came .
Moses therefore wrote this song the same day , and taught it the children of Israel .
If David then call him Lord , how is he his son ?
And they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head .
Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which by interpretation is called Dorcas : this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did .
And it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
And Peter said unto him , Aeneas , Jesus Christ maketh thee whole : arise , and make thy bed . And he arose immediately .
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him , and turned to the Lord .
And it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
Which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him forth to Tarsus .
Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost , were multiplied .
And sitting down they watched him there ;
And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again .
But I know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee .
Then said Martha unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
She saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come into the world .
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . Believest thou this ?
Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
Martha saith unto him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
And he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
And when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it ,
As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
And shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
And he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
Saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
And he taught daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
But bring your youngest brother unto me ; so shall your words be verified , and ye shall not die . And they did so .
Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
This Jesus hath God raised up , whereof we all are witnesses .
He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ , that his soul was not left in hell , neither his flesh did see corruption .
Therefore being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne ;
And said , If Esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which is left shall escape .
And Jacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the LORD which saidst unto me , Return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and I will deal well with thee :
And he commanded them , saying , Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau ; Thy servant Jacob saith thus , I have sojourned with Laban , and stayed there until now :
Now when they heard this , they were pricked in their heart , and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles , Men and brethren , what shall we do ?
And the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , We came to thy brother Esau , and also he cometh to meet thee , and four hundred men with him .
And Abram journeyed , going on still toward the south .
And Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .

Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites , and the family of the Shimites : these are the families of the Gershonites .

And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen , clean and white : for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints .
For I mean not that other men be eased , and ye burdened :
For true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
But by an equality , that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want , that their abundance also may be a supply for your want : that there may be equality :
And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , Alleluia ; Salvation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the Lord our God :
And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunderings , saying , Alleluia : for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth .
Let us be glad and rejoice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the Lamb is come , and his wife hath made herself ready .

From thence they removed , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites : for Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ?
And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then believed ye him not ?
But and if we say , Of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that John was a prophet .
And they answered , that they could not tell whence it was .
And it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the temple , and preached the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders ,
And spake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
And he answered and said unto them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
And your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
And Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
Then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
As they ministered to the Lord , and fasted , the Holy Ghost said , Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them .
And when they had fasted and prayed , and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
So they , being sent forth by the Holy Ghost , departed unto Seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
And when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar-jesus :
Which was with the deputy of the country , Sergius Paulus , a prudent man ; who called for Barnabas and Saul , and desired to hear the word of God .
But Elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith .
Then Saul , ( who also is called Paul , ) filled with the Holy Ghost , set his eyes on him ,
And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came : for the famine was in the land of Canaan .
But Benjamin , Joseph's brother , Jacob sent not with his brethren ; for he said , Lest peradventure mischief befall him .
And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt .
And he said , Behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt , Jacob said unto his sons , Why do ye look one upon another ?
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord : yet I give my judgment , as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful .
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
Let not then your good be evil spoken of :
But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat , now walkest thou not charitably . Destroy not him with thy meat , for whom Christ died .
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
Let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way .
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God .
For it is written , As I live , saith the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God .
But why dost thou judge thy brother ? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
And the priest shall look upon the plague , and shut up it that hath the plague seven days :
And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day : if the plague be spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in a skin , or in any work that is made of skin ; the plague is a fretting leprosy ; it is unclean .
He shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in woollen or in linen , or any thing of skin , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
And if the priest shall look , and , behold , the plague be not spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ;
Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
And the priest shall look on the plague , after that it is washed : and , behold , if the plague have not changed his colour , and the plague be not spread ; it is unclean ; thou shalt burn it in the fire ; it is fret inward , whether it be bare within or without .
Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things wherewith one may edify another .
For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God , and approved of men .
Then Sihon came out against us , he and all his people , to fight at Jahaz .
And the LORD our God delivered him before us ; and we smote him , and his sons , and all his people .
But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him : for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit , and made his heart obstinate , that he might deliver him into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
And the LORD said unto me , Behold , I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee : begin to possess , that thou mayest inherit his land .
From Aroer , which is by the brink of the river of Arnon , and from the city that is by the river , even unto Gilead , there was not one city too strong for us : the LORD our God delivered all unto us :
Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the river Jabbok , nor unto the cities in the mountains , nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us .
And we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name , he hath done evil to this people ; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all .
And he commanded the steward of his house , saying , Fill the men's sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man's money in his sack's mouth .
And they said unto them , The LORD look upon you , and judge ; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to slay us .
And they met Moses and Aaron , who stood in the way , as they came forth from Pharaoh :

There was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day :
The law and the prophets were until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth into it .
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fail .
And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
And he said unto them , Ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God .
And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's , who shall give you that which is your own ?
No servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye cannot serve God and mammon .
He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
And put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack's mouth of the youngest , and his corn money . And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
Is not this it in which my lord drinketh , and whereby indeed he divineth ? ye have done evil in so doing .
And when they were gone out of the city , and not yet far off , Joseph said unto his steward , Up , follow after the men ; and when thou dost overtake them , say unto them , Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good ?
And they said unto him , Wherefore saith my lord these words ? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing :
And he overtook them , and he spake unto them these same words .
So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
This they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ?
They say unto him , Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst ,
And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives .
And they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
And again he stooped down , and wrote on the ground .
Go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons' wives with thee .
Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
And in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .

And he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ;
And the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
And Noah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons' wives with him :
Every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the ark .
Bring the tribe of Levi near , and present them before Aaron the priest , that they may minister unto him .

The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which is blessed for evermore , knoweth that I lie not .
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison , desirous to apprehend me :
And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall , and escaped his hands .
We give thanks to God always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ;
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith , and labour of love , and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , in the sight of God and our Father ;

And ye became followers of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Ghost :
So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia .
Knowing , brethren beloved , your election of God .
For our gospel came not unto you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Ghost , and in much assurance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you , and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ;

That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform ; even a freewill offering , according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God , which thou hast promised with thy mouth .
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain : for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .

And thou shalt become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee .
So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour , then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand ; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn .

But neither Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised :
Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , and took Titus with me also .
But of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( whatsoever they were , it maketh no matter to me : God accepteth no man's person : ) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me :
But contrariwise , when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter ;
And that because of false brethren unawares brought in , who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into bondage :
To whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
( For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles : )
And when James , Cephas , and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the heathen , and they unto the circumcision .

And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , and make thereto a crown of gold round about .
For this is the will of God , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication :
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus .
Not in the lust of concupiscence , even as the Gentiles which know not God :
Ye are the children of the prophets , and of the covenant which God made with our fathers , saying unto Abraham , And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed .
For God hath not called us unto uncleanness , but unto holiness .
That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter : because that the Lord is the avenger of all such , as we also have forewarned you and testified .

For this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
But I say unto you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom .

O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them which are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
Wherefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city :
That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of hell ?
And say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .

Thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , O LORD , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanctuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
Fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , O LORD , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of Moab , trembling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away .

The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .
Therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
( It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
When Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby .
Then after that saith he to his disciples , Let us go into Judaea again .
When he had heard therefore that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was .

And say ye moreover , Behold , thy servant Jacob is behind us . For he said , I will appease him with the present that goeth before me , and afterward I will see his face ; peradventure he will accept of me .
So went the present over before him : and himself lodged that night in the company .
And he said , Let me go , for the day breaketh . And he said , I will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
And he said unto him , What is thy name ? And he said , Jacob .
And Jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
And he said , Thy name shall be called no more Jacob , but Israel : for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men , and hast prevailed .
And Jacob asked him , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , thy name . And he said , Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name ? And he blessed him there .
The great temptations which thine eyes saw , and the signs , and the wonders , and the mighty hand , and the stretched out arm , whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out : so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid .

Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering , even fine flour mingled with oil , and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering .

But the Jews which believed not , moved with envy , took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort , and gathered a company , and set all the city on an uproar , and assaulted the house of Jason , and sought to bring them out to the people .
And when they found them not , they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city , crying , These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also ;
Whom Jason hath received : and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , one Jesus .
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the Jews :
And Paul , as his manner was , went in unto them , and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
Opening and alleging , that Christ must needs have suffered , and risen again from the dead ; and that this Jesus , whom I preach unto you , is Christ .
And they knew not that Joseph understood them ; for he spake unto them by an interpreter .
And Reuben answered them , saying , Spake I not unto you , saying , Do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , behold , also his blood is required .
For the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
Know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the LORD he is God in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there is none else .
Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany , where Lazarus was which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon's son , which should betray him ,
Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ?
This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
Then said Jesus , Let her alone : against the day of my burying hath she kept this .
And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
And Balak said unto Balaam , What hast thou done unto me ? I took thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast blessed them altogether .
And he answered and said , Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth ?
And Balak said unto him , Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place , from whence thou mayest see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from thence .
And he brought him into the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
And he said unto Balak , Stand here by thy burnt offering , while I meet the LORD yonder .
And the LORD met Balaam , and put a word in his mouth , and said , Go again unto Balak , and say thus .
And when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . And Balak said unto him , What hath the LORD spoken ?
And he took up his parable , and said , Rise up , Balak , and hear ; hearken unto me , thou son of Zippor :
God is not a man , that he should lie ; neither the son of man , that he should repent : hath he said , and shall he not do it ? or hath he spoken , and shall he not make it good ?
Of all clean birds ye shall eat .
And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat ; it is unclean unto you .
And the pelican , and the gier eagle , and the cormorant ,
The little owl , and the great owl , and the swan ,
And the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind ,
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives : and the people multiplied , and waxed very mighty .
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus , and scourged him .
And said , Hail , King of the Jews ! and they smote him with their hands .
And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
Then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . And Pilate saith unto them , Behold the man !
Pilate therefore went forth again , and saith unto them , Behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him .
The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
And went again into the judgment hall , and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer .
When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ;
Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
And as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth .
Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . And they said unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
So the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
And it shall be , when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and possessest it , and dwellest therein ;
And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I profess this day unto the LORD thy God , that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us .
That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth , which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee , and shalt put it in a basket , and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there .
And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God , A Syrian ready to perish was my father , and he went down into Egypt , and sojourned there with a few , and became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous :
And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand , and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God .
And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers , the LORD heard our voice , and looked on our affliction , and our labour , and our oppression :
And the Egyptians evil entreated us , and afflicted us , and laid upon us hard bondage :
And he hath brought us into this place , and hath given us this land , even a land that floweth with milk and honey .
And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terribleness , and with signs , and with wonders :
Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me .
And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said unto them , Come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
For thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
For if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep .
Wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
But when we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
And they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
And if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . And the rest will I set in order when I come .
But they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
And as they thus spake , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
Behold my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
And he said unto them , Why are ye troubled ? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ?
I prayed therefore unto the LORD , and said , O Lord GOD , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
Remember thy servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin :
And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him : and I prayed for Aaron also the same time .
And I took your sin , the calf which ye had made , and burnt it with fire , and stamped it , and ground it very small , even until it was as small as dust : and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount .
And at Taberah , and at Massah , and at Kibroth-hattaavah , ye provoked the LORD to wrath .
Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea , saying , Go up and possess the land which I have given you ; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God , and ye believed him not , nor hearkened to his voice .
But the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew . And they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour :
Come on , let us deal wisely with them ; lest they multiply , and it come to pass , that , when there falleth out any war , they join also unto our enemies , and fight against us , and so get them up out of the land .
Through faith he kept the passover , and the sprinkling of blood , lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them .
Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens . And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities , Pithom and Raamses .
And he took up his parable , and said , Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram , out of the mountains of the east , saying , Come , curse me Jacob , and come , defy Israel .
But the midwives feared God , and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them , but saved the men children alive .
Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite , and Joshua the son of Nun : for they have wholly followed the LORD .
And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the LORD , was consumed .
And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time , and he sware , saying ,
Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt , from twenty years old and upward , shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob ; because they have not wholly followed me :
And they came near unto him , and said , We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle , and cities for our little ones :
And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , wherein they made them serve , was with rigour .
And , behold , ye are risen up in your fathers' stead , an increase of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel .
For if ye turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and ye shall destroy all this people .
So I took the chief of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties , and captains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
And ye answered me , and said , The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do .
We will not return unto our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives , of which the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah :
( The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and bless you , as he hath promised you ! )
The LORD your God hath multiplied you , and , behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
Take you wise men , and understanding , and known among your tribes , and I will make them rulers over you .
How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ?
They answered and said unto him , Thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? And they cast him out .
And Jesus said unto him , Thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee .
He answered and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might believe on him ?
Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
The man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
If this man were not of God , he could do nothing .
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
And Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
And he said , Lord , I believe . And he worshipped him .
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor , by the coast of the land of Edom , saying ,
And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him : and he dipped his finger in the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar , and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar :
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up unto mount Hor :
That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he , and his children , in the midst of Israel .
And strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
And Moses did as the LORD commanded : and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation .
So they went near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp ; as Moses had said .
And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city , and communed with the men of their city , saying ,
These men are peaceable with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us , to be one people , if every male among us be circumcised , as they are circumcised .
Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours ? only let us consent unto them , and they will dwell with us .
And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circumcised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
And it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , Dinah's brethren , took each man his sword , and came upon the city boldly , and slew all the males .
And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem's house , and went out .
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain , and spoiled the city , because they had defiled their sister .
They took their sheep , and their oxen , and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
And all their wealth , and all their little ones , and their wives took they captive , and spoiled even all that was in the house .
And he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over every one of them .

And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled : and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people , and they said , Why have we done this , that we have let Israel go from serving us ?
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart , that he shall follow after them ; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host ; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD . And they did so .
For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , They are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
Speak unto the children of Israel , that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth , between Migdol and the sea , over against Baal-zephon : before it shall ye encamp by the sea .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
He which testifieth these things saith , Surely I come quickly . Amen . Even so , come , Lord Jesus .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
For that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious .
Speak unto Aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them , Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers in Israel , that will offer his oblation for all his vows , and for all his freewill offerings , which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering ;

Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days ; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD .
And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses , so he made the candlestick .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
Then were there two thieves crucified with him , one on the right hand , and another on the left .
And they that passed by reviled him , wagging their heads ,
And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath , from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering ; seven sabbaths shall be complete :
Speak unto Aaron , and say unto him , When thou lightest the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick .
And Aaron did so ; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick , as the LORD commanded Moses .

When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .

Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles , whom God drave out before the face of our fathers , unto the days of David ;

Now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake . And they launched forth .
But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . Then he arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
And he said unto them , Where is your faith ? And they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .

I am the vine , ye are the branches : He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
I am the true vine , and my Father is the husbandman .
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you .
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
As the Father hath loved me , so have I loved you : continue ye in my love .
Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples .

Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .

Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place : with a young bullock for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering .
He shall put on the holy linen coat , and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh , and shall be girded with a linen girdle , and with the linen mitre shall he be attired : these are holy garments ; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water , and so put them on .
And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering , and one ram for a burnt offering .
And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and make an atonement for himself , and for his house .
And he shall take the two goats , and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats ; one lot for the LORD , and the other lot for the scapegoat .
And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell , and offer him for a sin offering .
And it shall be , when ye are come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
And ye shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
Let there more work be laid upon the men , that they may labour therein ; and let them not regard vain words .
And the tale of the bricks , which they did make heretofore , ye shall lay upon them ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , saying , Let us go and sacrifice to our God .
And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .

And the king of Egypt said unto them , Wherefore do ye , Moses and Aaron , let the people from their works ? get you unto your burdens .
Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let them go and gather straw for themselves .
And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people , and their officers , saying ,
And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people , and blessed them , and came down from offering of the sin offering , and the burnt offering , and peace offerings .
And I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land safely .
Then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering , if he offer it of the herd ; whether it be a male or female , he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD .
And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief .

But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
For such are false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ .
As the truth of Christ is in me , no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
Wherefore ? because I love you not ? God knoweth .
I say again , Let no man think me a fool ; if otherwise , yet as a fool receive me , that I may boast myself a little .
That which I speak , I speak it not after the Lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence of boasting .
And no marvel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
Seeing that many glory after the flesh , I will glory also .
For ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise .

I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father .
I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
Then said Jesus again unto them , I go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither I go , ye cannot come .

To be a memorial unto the children of Israel , that no stranger , which is not of the seed of Aaron , come near to offer incense before the LORD ; that he be not as Korah , and as his company : as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses .
And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and did run to bring his disciples word .

And they shall turn away their ears from the truth , and shall be turned unto fables .
But watch thou in all things , endure afflictions , do the work of an evangelist , make full proof of thy ministry .
Preach the word ; be instant in season , out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine .

I charge thee therefore before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom ;
Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , shall give me at that day : and not to me only , but unto all them also that love his appearing .

Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill , and said , Ye men of Athens , I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious .

And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation ;
That they should seek the Lord , if haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
God that made the world and all things therein , seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands ;
Neither is worshipped with men's hands , as though he needed any thing , seeing he giveth to all life , and breath , and all things ;
For in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , For we are also his offspring .

Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you ?
But be it so , I did not burden you : nevertheless , being crafty , I caught you with guile .
And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you ; though the more abundantly I love you , the less I be loved .
Behold , the third time I am ready to come to you ; and I will not be burdensome to you : for I seek not yours , but you : for the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you ? forgive me this wrong .
Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience , in signs , and wonders , and mighty deeds .
I am become a fool in glorying ; ye have compelled me : for I ought to have been commended of you : for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles , though I be nothing .
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for Christ's sake : for when I am weak , then am I strong .
Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .

That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth ;
And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
Holding forth the word of life ; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither laboured in vain .
Yea , and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I joy , and rejoice with you all .
Do all things without murmurings and disputings :
That ye may be blameless and harmless , the sons of God , without rebuke , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ;
Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before ,
For the same cause also do ye joy , and rejoice with me .

And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee : for thy merchants were the great men of the earth ; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived .
And the voice of harpers , and musicians , and of pipers , and trumpeters , shall be heard no more at all in thee ; and no craftsman , of whatsoever craft he be , shall be found any more in thee ; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee ;
And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .

And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit ; and they shall prophesy :
Saying , We give thee thanks , O Lord God Almighty , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .

Phrygia , and Pamphylia , in Egypt , and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene , and strangers of Rome , Jews and proselytes ,
Others mocking said , These men are full of new wine .
And they were all amazed , and were in doubt , saying one to another , What meaneth this ?
For these are not drunken , as ye suppose , seeing it is but the third hour of the day .
But Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said unto them , Ye men of Judaea , and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem , be this known unto you , and hearken to my words :
And it shall come to pass in the last days , saith God , I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams :
But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel ;
But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove , and would have set them at one again , saying , Sirs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
And seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , and smote the Egyptian :
For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient , by word and deed ,
Through mighty signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God ; so that from Jerusalem , and round about unto Illyricum , I have fully preached the gospel of Christ .
And when he was cast out , Pharaoh's daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
In which time Moses was born , and was exceeding fair , and nourished up in his father's house three months :
And I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
Nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Ghost .
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God .
And again he saith , Rejoice , ye Gentiles , with his people .
And again , Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles ; and laud him , all ye people .
And again , Esaias saith , There shall be a root of Jesse , and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles ; in him shall the Gentiles trust .

And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
And when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of every city , he spake by a parable :

But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
And the waters returned , and covered the chariots , and the horsemen , and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them ; there remained not so much as one of them .
And took off their chariot wheels , that they drave them heavily : so that the Egyptians said , Let us flee from the face of Israel ; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians .
And it came to pass , that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the Egyptians ,

And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel ; and it was a cloud and darkness to them , but it gave light by night to these : so that the one came not near the other all the night .

And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
And as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
Woe unto you , lawyers ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
And he spake this parable unto them , saying ,
What man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost .
I say unto you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance .
Either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , Rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .

Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ?
A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father .
All things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye cannot bear them now .
Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ;
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?

And he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
And the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
And when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently betray him .
And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests , to betray him unto them .
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve .
And his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us .
And wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
And they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
And as they sat and did eat , Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , One of you which eateth with me shall betray me .
And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did they unto them .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
And the Levites were purified , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD ; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them .
But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge .
This is it that belongeth unto the Levites : from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation :
And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof , and shall serve no more :
And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce him clean : it is but a scab : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
Of Gad ; Eliasaph the son of Deuel .
Naphtali is a hind let loose : he giveth goodly words .
And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah : because there they buried the people that lusted .
And while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ere it was chewed , the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people , and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague .
And the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the quails : he that gathered least gathered ten homers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
And there went forth a wind from the LORD , and brought quails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , as it were a day's journey on this side , and as it were a day's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth .
And Moses gat him into the camp , he and the elders of Israel .
Or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
Of Naphtali ; Ahira the son of Enan .
Except it be for this one voice , that I cried standing among them , Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day .
And the sons of Judah ; Er , and Onan , and Shelah , and Pharez , and Zerah : but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan . And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul .
And the sons of Issachar ; Tola , and Phuvah , and Job , and Shimron .
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
These be the sons of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram , with his daughter Dinah : all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
These were the renowned of the congregation , princes of the tribes of their fathers , heads of thousands in Israel .
They shall have like portions to eat , beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony .
And the sons of Gad ; Ziphion , and Haggi , Shuni , and Ezbon , Eri , and Arodi , and Areli .
The firstfruit also of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the first of the fleece of thy sheep , shalt thou give him .
For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes , to stand to minister in the name of the LORD , him and his sons for ever .
And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel , where he sojourned , and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose ;
And the sons of Asher ; Jimnah , and Ishuah , and Isui , and Beriah , and Serah their sister : and the sons of Beriah ; Heber , and Malchiel .
The priests the Levites , and all the tribe of Levi , shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel : they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and his inheritance .
Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren : the LORD is their inheritance , as he hath said unto them .
And this shall be the priest's due from the people , from them that offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep ; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
The archers have sorely grieved him , and shot at him , and hated him :
And he charged them , and said unto them , I am to be gathered unto my people : bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife ; Joseph , and Benjamin .
And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God .
But when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold , and said , It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the Gentiles .
Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf : in the morning he shall devour the prey , and at night he shall divide the spoil .
Beware therefore , lest that come upon you , which is spoken of in the prophets ;
Behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish : for I work a work in your days , a work which ye shall in no wise believe , though a man declare it unto you .
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue , the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath .
Now when the congregation was broken up , many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas : who , speaking to them , persuaded them to continue in the grace of God .
Lest ye corrupt yourselves , and make you a graven image , the similitude of any figure , the likeness of male or female ,
The likeness of any beast that is on the earth , the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air ,
And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire :
And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
And he declared unto you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even ten commandments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb , when the LORD said unto me , Gather me the people together , and I will make them hear my words , that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth , and that they may teach their children .
And ye came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , clouds , and thick darkness .
But not as the offence , so also is the free gift . For if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .
The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth :
And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven , and when thou seest the sun , and the moon , and the stars , even all the host of heaven , shouldest be driven to worship them , and serve them , which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven .
But when raw flesh appeareth in him , he shall be unclean .
And the priest shall see the raw flesh , and pronounce him to be unclean : for the raw flesh is unclean : it is a leprosy .
Or if the raw flesh turn again , and be changed unto white , he shall come unto the priest ;
And the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the plague be turned into white ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : he is clean .
And the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the rising be white in the skin , and it have turned the hair white , and there be quick raw flesh in the rising ;
It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh , and the priest shall pronounce him unclean , and shall not shut him up : for he is unclean .
And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin , and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot , wheresoever the priest looketh ;
Then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the leprosy have covered all his flesh , he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : it is all turned white : he is clean .
The flesh also , in which , even in the skin thereof , was a boil , and is healed ,
And in the place of the boil there be a white rising , or a bright spot , white , and somewhat reddish , and it be shewed to the priest ;
And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp .
And they did beat the gold into thin plates , and cut it into wires , to work it in the blue , and in the purple , and in the scarlet , and in the fine linen , with cunning work .
Take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou , and Aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes ; and it shall give forth his water , and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink .
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come .
And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they fell upon their faces : and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness , that we and our cattle should die there ?
And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in unto this evil place ? it is no place of seed , or of figs , or of vines , or of pomegranates ; neither is there any water to drink .
And there was no water for the congregation : and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron .
And the people chode with Moses , and spake , saying , Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD !
When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel .
Then came the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of Zin in the first month : and the people abode in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
And they asked him , saying , Why say the scribes that Elias must first come ?
Of Benjamin ; Abidan the son of Gideoni .
For if by one man's offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
And they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
Of Dan ; Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai .
Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made . And he said unto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
And the woman said unto the serpent , We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden :
And not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
And the serpent said unto the woman , Ye shall not surely die :
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .
And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree to be desired to make one wise , she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat , and gave also unto her husband with her ; and he did eat .
And the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden .
And the LORD God called unto Adam , and said unto him , Where art thou ?
Of Asher ; Pagiel the son of Ocran .
Therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word , or our epistle .
Whereunto he called you by our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
Comfort your hearts , and stablish you in every good word and work .
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God , even our Father , which hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace ,
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion , that they should believe a lie :
And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you , brethren beloved of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth :
That they all might be damned who believed not the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God : for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers , as it is this day .
And it shall be , if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish .
Lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses , and dwelt therein ;
And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten ; it shall be burnt with fire : and as for the flesh , all that be clean shall eat thereof .
When thou hast eaten and art full , then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee .
Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God , in not keeping his commandments , and his judgments , and his statutes , which I command thee this day :
Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
And thou say in thine heart , My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth .
Then thine heart be lifted up , and thou forget the LORD thy God , which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage ;
For if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
They say unto him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened .
And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
And the multitude rebuked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
For I was an hungred , and ye gave me no meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink :
Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .
Then shall they also answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister unto thee ?
But exhort one another daily , while it is called To day ; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
So Jesus had compassion on them , and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him .
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief .
And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ?
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
( For until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life .
But if the ministration of death , written and engraven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance ; which glory was to be done away :
And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward :
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
Ye are our epistle written in our hearts , known and read of all men :
Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
Do we begin again to commend ourselves ? or need we , as some others , epistles of commendation to you , or letters of commendation from you ?
How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious ?
For if the ministration of condemnation be glory , much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory .
Besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings .
And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt ,
That the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , I am the LORD : speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee .
These are that Aaron and Moses , to whom the LORD said , Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Moses and Aaron .
And the sons of Korah ; Assir , and Elkanah , and Abiasaph : these are the families of the Korhites .
Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned :
And the sons of Uzziel ; Mishael , and Elzaphan , and Zithri .
And Aaron took him Elisheba , daughter of Amminadab , sister of Naashon , to wife ; and she bare him Nadab , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
And the sons of Izhar ; Korah , and Nepheg , and Zichri .
And immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God .
And Jesus said unto him , Receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee .
Saying , What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receive my sight .
And Jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him ,
Now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
There is no fear of God before their eyes .
Their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have used deceit ; the poison of asps is under their lips :
They are all gone out of the way , they are together become unprofitable ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
There is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after God .
As it is written , There is none righteous , no , not one :
And the way of peace have they not known :
Destruction and misery are in their ways :
Their feet are swift to shed blood :
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness :
Thus have I been twenty years in thy house ; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters , and six years for thy cattle : and thou hast changed my wages ten times .
Thus I was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep departed from mine eyes .
And Laban answered and said unto Jacob , These daughters are my daughters , and these children are my children , and these cattle are my cattle , and all that thou seest is mine : and what can I do this day unto these my daughters , or unto their children which they have born ?
Except the God of my father , the God of Abraham , and the fear of Isaac , had been with me , surely thou hadst sent me away now empty . God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands , and rebuked thee yesternight .
And Jacob took a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
Now therefore come thou , let us make a covenant , I and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha : but Jacob called it Galeed .
And Jacob said unto his brethren , Gather stones ; and they took stones , and made an heap : and they did eat there upon the heap .

For this cause , when I could no longer forbear , I sent to know your faith , lest by some means the tempter have tempted you , and our labour be in vain .
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us , and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity , and that ye have good remembrance of us always , desiring greatly to see us , as we also to see you :
Therefore , brethren , we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith :
Wherefore when we could no longer forbear , we thought it good to be left at Athens alone ;
And sent Timotheus , our brother , and minister of God , and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith :
That no man should be moved by these afflictions : for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto .
For verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .

For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .

His lord answered and said unto him , Thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gather where I have not strawed :

And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , I have gained beside them five talents more .
Because he hath despised the word of the LORD , and hath broken his commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; his iniquity shall be upon him .
For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
Take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the LORD ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .

The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt , and with the emerods , and with the scab , and with the itch , whereof thou canst not be healed .

Thou shalt beget sons and daughters , but thou shalt not enjoy them ; for they shall go into captivity .
Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast his fruit .
Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , for the abundance of all things ;
And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder , and upon thy seed for ever .
Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee , and shall pursue thee , and overtake thee , till thou be destroyed ; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee :
He shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to him : he shall be the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whither thou goest to possess it .
The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far , from the end of the earth , as swift as the eagle flieth ; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand ;
Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroyed thee .
The LORD shall send upon thee cursing , vexation , and rebuke , in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do , until thou be destroyed , and until thou perish quickly ; because of the wickedness of thy doings , whereby thou hast forsaken me .

And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night , and said unto him , Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
And he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days' journey ; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead .
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled .
So he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount Gilead .
And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
And when they had received it , they murmured against the goodman of the house ,
But when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .

All these cities were fenced with high walls , gates , and bars ; beside unwalled towns a great many .
And we utterly destroyed them , as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon , utterly destroying the men , women , and children , of every city .
And the third angel followed them , saying with a loud voice , If any man worship the beast and his image , and receive his mark in his forehead , or in his hand ,
And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering .
But all the cattle , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey to ourselves .
Then we turned , and went up the way to Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
And the LORD said unto me , Fear him not : for I will deliver him , and all his people , and his land , into thy hand ; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon .
So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also , the king of Bashan , and all his people : and we smote him until none was left to him remaining .

Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ;
And supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon's son , to betray him ;
Now before the feast of the passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end .

Thou fool , that which thou sowest is not quickened , except it die :
Be merciful , O LORD , unto thy people Israel , whom thou hast redeemed , and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge . And the blood shall be forgiven them .
So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD .

So likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he cannot be my disciple .

Thou shalt stand abroad , and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee .

And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be his .
But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto , let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD , even to the priest ; beside the ram of the atonement , whereby an atonement shall be made for him .
Both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they defile not their camps , in the midst whereof I dwell .
Command the children of Israel , that they put out of the camp every leper , and every one that hath an issue , and whosoever is defiled by the dead :
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
Then they shall confess their sin which they have done : and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
Speak unto the children of Israel , When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit , to do a trespass against the LORD , and that person be guilty ;
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the LORD spake unto Moses , so did the children of Israel .

Therefore I write these things being absent , lest being present I should use sharpness , according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification , and not to destruction .
Finally , brethren , farewell . Be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you .
Greet one another with an holy kiss .
All the saints salute you .
Thou shalt not eat it ; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water .
Thou shalt not eat it ; that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD .
Only thy holy things which thou hast , and thy vows , thou shalt take , and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose :
And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the LORD thy God : and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border , as he hath promised thee , and thou shalt say , I will eat flesh , because thy soul longeth to eat flesh ; thou mayest eat flesh , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee , then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock , which the LORD hath given thee , as I have commanded thee , and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat them : the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike .
Only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
Observe and hear all these words which I command thee , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee for ever , when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God .
And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
For the LORD your God is God of gods , and Lord of lords , a great God , a mighty , and a terrible , which regardeth not persons , nor taketh reward :
The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be snared therein : for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God .
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart , and be no more stiffnecked .
Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee , and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction , until they be destroyed .
Behold , the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God , the earth also , with all that therein is .
The cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest's office .
The pins of the tabernacle , and the pins of the court , and their cords ,
And the incense altar , and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle ,
The candlestick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lamps , with the oil for the light ,
The hangings of the court , his pillars , and their sockets , and the hanging for the door of the court ,
The altar of burnt offering , with his brasen grate , his staves , and all his vessels , the laver and his foot ,
The tabernacle , his tent , and his covering , his taches , and his boards , his bars , his pillars , and his sockets ,
And every wise hearted among you shall come , and make all that the LORD hath commanded ;
For if our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
The ark , and the staves thereof , with the mercy seat , and the vail of the covering ,
If he hath wronged thee , or oweth thee ought , put that on mine account ;
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
And the LORD said unto me , Arise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them .
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds :
Which in time past was to thee unprofitable , but now profitable to thee and to me :
Whom I have sent again : thou therefore receive him , that is , mine own bowels :
Whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
But without thy mind would I do nothing ; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity , but willingly .
For perhaps he therefore departed for a season , that thou shouldest receive him for ever ;
Not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
If thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it , and it shall be assured to him .

And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an atonement for himself , and for his household , and for all the congregation of Israel .
If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile , according to thy estimation it shall stand .
And in nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that of God .
For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ , not only to believe on him , but also to suffer for his sake ;
But if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
For I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better :
According to my earnest expectation and my hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but that with all boldness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether it be by life , or by death .
For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again .
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you .
And having this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith ;
And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
For the life of the flesh is in the blood : and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls : for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul .
And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession , then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof : an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver .
Therefore I said unto the children of Israel , No soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
Make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ ; to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
Now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty ; with whom , if he come shortly , I will see you .
And I beseech you , brethren , suffer the word of exhortation : for I have written a letter unto you in few words .
Salute all them that have the rule over you , and all the saints . They of Italy salute you .
For it is the life of all flesh ; the blood of it is for the life thereof : therefore I said unto the children of Israel , Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh : for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof : whosoever eateth it shall be cut off .
And every soul that eateth that which died of itself , or that which was torn with beasts , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger , he shall both wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even : then shall he be clean .
And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
And one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and the meat offering thereof , and their drink offerings .
And one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it , and it shall be his .
And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks , two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams ,
And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs :
And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work , and ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days :
And ye shall offer a burnt offering , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD ; thirteen young bullocks , two rams , and fourteen lambs of the first year ; they shall be without blemish :
A several tenth deal for one lamb , throughout the seven lambs :
One kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the sin offering of atonement , and the continual burnt offering , and the meat offering of it , and their drink offerings .
And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls : for Joseph was in Egypt already .
Dan , and Naphtali , Gad , and Asher .
And the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
Knowing this first , that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation .
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
And he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
Saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
And he straitly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing ;
He said unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? Peter answering said , The Christ of God .
But I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father's , and of the holy angels .
For what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
Now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
And he looked on the Kenites , and took up his parable , and said , Strong is thy dwellingplace , and thou puttest thy nest in a rock .
Wherefore the people did chide with Moses , and said , Give us water that we may drink . And Moses said unto them , Why chide ye with me ? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD ?
And the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin , after their journeys , according to the commandment of the LORD , and pitched in Rephidim : and there was no water for the people to drink .
Behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin ,
And Moses cried unto the LORD , saying , What shall I do unto this people ? they be almost ready to stone me .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and thy rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
Then came Amalek , and fought with Israel in Rephidim .
Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah ,
But if he will at all redeem it , then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation .
And they shall be coupled together beneath , and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring : thus shall it be for them both ; they shall be for the two corners .
And they shall be eight boards , and their sockets of silver , sixteen sockets ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
And the priest shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as thou valuest it , who art the priest , so shall it be .
And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards :
And their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
And she said unto her , Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband ? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also ? And Rachel said , Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes .
And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest , and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Leah . Then Rachel said to Leah , Give me , I pray thee , of thy son's mandrakes .
And God hearkened unto Leah , and she conceived , and bare Jacob the fifth son .
And Jacob came out of the field in the evening , and Leah went out to meet him , and said , Thou must come in unto me ; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes . And he lay with her that night .
And Leah said , A troop cometh : and she called his name Gad .
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son .
And Leah said , Happy am I , for the daughters will call me blessed : and she called his name Asher .
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son .
And those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
And there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day :
And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai : according to all that the LORD commanded Moses , so did the children of Israel .
But if he sanctify his field after the jubile , then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain , even unto the year of the jubile , and it shall be abated from thy estimation .

And Leah said , God hath given me my hire , because I have given my maiden to my husband : and she called his name Issachar .
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house :
Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains :
And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many .
And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
And woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
But he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you , Ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off :
And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God ,
And when he saw them , he said unto them , Go shew yourselves unto the priests . And it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
And Jesus answering said , Were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
And fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement : it shall be an holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall afflict your souls , and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , In the seventh month , in the first day of the month , shall ye have a sabbath , a memorial of blowing of trumpets , an holy convocation .
Ye shall do no servile work therein : but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
As thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world .
And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth .
I have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth .
And all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them .
And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest me I have kept , and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled .
And now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD , with the two lambs : they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest .
And that ye may prolong your days in the land , which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ;
But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did .
And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , the son of Reuben : how the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and their tents , and all the substance that was in their possession , in the midst of all Israel :
And what he did unto you in the wilderness , until ye came into this place ;
And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day , that it may be an holy convocation unto you : ye shall do no servile work therein : it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations .
And his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
And know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm ,
Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God , and keep his charge , and his statutes , and his judgments , and his commandments , alway .
And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons , and consecrate them , that they may minister unto me in the priest's office .
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations .
And he said unto her , Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
While he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Master .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Take unto thee sweet spices , stacte , and onycha , and galbanum ; these sweet spices with pure frankincense : of each shall there be a like weight :
And thou shalt make it a perfume , a confection after the art of the apothecary , tempered together , pure and holy :
And thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
And as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof : it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD .
And it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
And when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless .
And it came to pass , that , when Jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
And , behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin's name was Mary .
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me , to take away my reproach among men .
And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them , and unto all men ;
For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God ;
Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness , which causeth through us thanksgiving to God .
Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food , and multiply your seed sown , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ; )
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift .
And by their prayer for you , which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you .
But if thou shalt forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in thee .
Grace be to you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
And Moses spake unto Aaron , and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons that were left , Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and eat it without leaven beside the altar : for it is most holy :
But the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which the LORD thy God hath given thee .
Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
But of the cities of these people , which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth :
Ye shall not steal , neither deal falsely , neither lie one to another .
Neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
And it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
But neither so did their witness agree together .
We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands .
And there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
For many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together .
And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
And Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
And they all forsook him , and fled .
And this is the charge of their burden , according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation ; the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and sockets thereof ,
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them , every one that entereth into the service , to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation .
This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari , according to all their service , in the tabernacle of the congregation , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
And the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords , with all their instruments , and with all their service : and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden .
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation :
And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families , and after the house of their fathers ,
And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ;
And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
Men's hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .
But woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
For these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
And he spake to them a parable ; Behold the fig tree , and all the trees ;
And when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh .
Of Zebulun ; Eliab the son of Helon .
Of Issachar ; Nethaneel the son of Zuar .
Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart : thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour , and not suffer sin upon him .
Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
But ye , brethren , be not weary in well doing .
For even when we were with you , this we commanded you , that if any would not work , neither should he eat .
Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , to the saints which are at Ephesus , and to the faithful in Christ Jesus :
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means . The Lord be with you all .
The salutation of Paul with mine own hand , which is the token in every epistle : so I write .
And if any man obey not our word by this epistle , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed .
Yet count him not as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
That ye would walk worthy of God , who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory .
For this cause also thank we God without ceasing , because , when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us , ye received it not as the word of men , but as it is in truth , the word of God , which effectually worketh also in you that believe .
And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness : and he came to Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
To the praise of the glory of his grace , wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved .
And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites , saying ,
And from Bamoth in the valley , that is in the country of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looketh toward Jeshimon .
Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say , Come into Heshbon , let the city of Sihon be built and prepared :
For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Arnon .
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
If Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub .
But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
And others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
But some of them said , He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils .
And he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . And it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
Or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , and one ram , and seven lambs of the first year : they shall be unto you without blemish :
In the first day shall be an holy convocation ; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein :
And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , and one ram , seven lambs of the first year without spot ;
Wherefore we would have come unto you , even I Paul , once and again ; but Satan hindered us .
And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb ; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one bullock ; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one ram ;
And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered , beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock , and the third part of an hin unto a ram , and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb : this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast : seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten .
In whom we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to the riches of his grace ;
And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the brasen altar , and the brasen grate for it , and all the vessels of the altar ,
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart , and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt .
Thou shalt speak all that I command thee : and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh , that he send the children of Israel out of his land .
And the LORD said unto Moses , See , I have made thee a god to Pharaoh : and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet .
And Moses was fourscore years old , and Aaron fourscore and three years old , when they spake unto Pharaoh .
And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them , so did they .
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that I may lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
When Pharaoh shall speak unto you , saying , Shew a miracle for you : then thou shalt say unto Aaron , Take thy rod , and cast it before Pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent .
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love :
But glory , honour , and peace , to every man that worketh good , to the Jew first , and also to the Gentile :
For there is no respect of persons with God .
For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ;
( For not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
For when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another ; )
In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel .
Behold , thou art called a Jew , and restest in the law , and makest thy boast of God ,
And knowest his will , and approvest the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the law ;
And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you , and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles , that one should have his father's wife .
Not that I speak in respect of want : for I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content .
For I verily , as absent in body , but present in spirit , have judged already , as though I were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed ,
And ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you .
To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , when ye are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
Purge out therefore the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , as ye are unleavened . For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us :
Your glorying is not good . Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump ?
I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators :
Therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
As he hath done this day , so the LORD hath commanded to do , to make an atonement for you .
Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days , and keep the charge of the LORD , that ye die not : for so I am commanded .
And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire .
And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days , until the days of your consecration be at an end : for seven days shall he consecrate you .
And Moses took of the anointing oil , and of the blood which was upon the altar , and sprinkled it upon Aaron , and upon his garments , and upon his sons , and upon his sons' garments with him ; and sanctified Aaron , and his garments , and his sons , and his sons' garments with him .
And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons , Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations , as I commanded , saying , Aaron and his sons shall eat it .
Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not so to be .
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter ?
Can the fig tree , my brethren , bear olive berries ? either a vine , figs ? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh .
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you ? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom .
The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
For where envying and strife is , there is confusion and every evil work .
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be intreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world .
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them :
He answered and said unto them , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ;
Then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field :
Let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn .
Another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
And now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
If ye know that he is righteous , ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him .
And if his offering be of the flocks , namely , of the sheep , or of the goats , for a burnt sacrifice ; he shall bring it a male without blemish .
But ye have an unction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? He is antichrist , that denieth the Father and the Son .
Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : ( but ) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
Let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
And this is the promise that he hath promised us , even eternal life .
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you .
But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you , and ye need not that any man teach you : but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth , and is no lie , and even as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in him .
For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator .
And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ;
Which stood only in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal ordinances , imposed on them until the time of reformation .
For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood .
And said , By myself have I sworn , saith the LORD , for because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son :
That in blessing I will bless thee , and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven , and as the sand which is upon the sea shore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies ;
And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh : as it is said to this day , In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen .
And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time ,
And he said , Lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son from me .
And Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
And Abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven , and said , Abraham , Abraham : and he said , Here am I .
And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .
So Abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba ; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba .
Now when much time was spent , and when sailing was now dangerous , because the fast was now already past , Paul admonished them ,
And , hardly passing it , came unto a place which is called The fair havens ; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea .
Not slothful in business ; fervent in spirit ; serving the Lord ;
And the next day we touched at Sidon . And Julius courteously entreated Paul , and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself .
And entering into a ship of Adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius , a centurion of Augustus' band .
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from before Pharaoh .
And when we had sailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against Cnidus , the wind not suffering us , we sailed under Crete , over against Salmone ;
And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy ; and he put us therein .
And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
And when we had launched from thence , we sailed under Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
And I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
And I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire .
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire . This is the second death .
And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high hills , that were under the whole heaven , were covered .
And the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
And the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
And they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him : and the LORD shut him in .
And they went in unto Noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein is the breath of life .
They , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort .
In the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and Ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ;
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights .
In the six hundredth year of Noah's life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened .
And it came to pass after seven days , that the waters of the flood were upon the earth .
Also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the LORD bring upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
And it shall come to pass , that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you ; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to nought ; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it .
And ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God .
And among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor thy fathers have known , even wood and stone .
And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear day and night , and shalt have none assurance of thy life :
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father , and given them to me .
If he said thus , The speckled shall be thy wages ; then all the cattle bare speckled : and if he said thus , The ringstraked shall be thy hire ; then bare all the cattle ringstraked .
And said unto them , I see your father's countenance , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father hath been with me .
And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock ,
And your father hath deceived me , and changed my wages ten times ; but God suffered him not to hurt me .
And ye know that with all my power I have served your father .
And he heard the words of Laban's sons , saying , Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's ; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory .
And the LORD said unto Jacob , Return unto the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred ; and I will be with thee .
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban , and , behold , it was not toward him as before .
But the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
And the foolish said unto the wise , Give us of your oil ; for our lamps are gone out .
While the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
And at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
They that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
And five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
Speak not thou in thine heart , after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee , saying , For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land : but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee .
Not for thy righteousness , or for the uprightness of thine heart , dost thou go to possess their land : but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee , and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
These have one mind , and shall give their power and strength unto the beast .
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings , which have received no kingdom as yet ; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast .
And the beast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , and is of the seven , and goeth into perdition .
And there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will , and to agree , and give their kingdom unto the beast , until the words of God shall be fulfilled .
And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
And he saith unto me , The waters which thou sawest , where the whore sitteth , are peoples , and multitudes , and nations , and tongues .
These shall make war with the Lamb , and the Lamb shall overcome them : for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings : and they that are with him are called , and chosen , and faithful .
And thou shalt be blessed ; for they cannot recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just .
And the woman which thou sawest is that great city , which reigneth over the kings of the earth .
And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
I tell you that he will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
And shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge saith .
Yet because this widow troubleth me , I will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me .
And he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Though I fear not God , nor regard man ;
And there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him , saying , Avenge me of mine adversary .
Saying , There was in a city a judge , which feared not God , neither regarded man :
And he spake a parable unto them to this end , that men ought always to pray , and not to faint ;
Who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also Moses was faithful in all his house .
For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses , inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house .
But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him , he took the vail off , until he came out . And he came out , and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses' face shone : and Moses put the vail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
And Moses called unto them ; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him : and Moses talked with them .
And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai .
And till Moses had done speaking with them , he put a vail on his face .
For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
Wherefore , holy brethren , partakers of the heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession , Christ Jesus ;
When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .

And after the sop Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus unto him , That thou doest , do quickly .
Jesus answered , He it is , to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy , whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing .
Even such as he is able to get , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , with the meat offering : and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD .
The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar ; it shall never go out .
And he shall look on the plague , and , behold , if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes , greenish or reddish , which in sight are lower than the wall ;
For every house is builded by some man ; but he that built all things is God .
And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house :
When ye be come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ;
And the LORD said unto Moses , Behold , thou shalt sleep with thy fathers ; and this people will rise up , and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land , whither they go to be among them , and will forsake me , and break my covenant which I have made with them .
Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife , neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house , his field , or his manservant , or his maidservant , his ox , or his ass , or any thing that is thy neighbour's .
And the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ;
And Moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
Gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the LORD your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
And that their children , which have not known any thing , may hear , and learn to fear the LORD your God , as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it .
And Moses commanded them , saying , At the end of every seven years , in the solemnity of the year of release , in the feast of tabernacles ,
When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
Who was before a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and injurious : but I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who hath enabled me , for that he counted me faithful , putting me into the ministry ;
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
For whoremongers , for them that defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ;
Now unto the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only wise God , be honour and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting .
This is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .

Holding faith , and a good conscience ; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck :

For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
And in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house .

Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way .
Go your ways : behold , I send you forth as lambs among wolves .

And into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
If any man speak , let him speak as the oracles of God ; if any man minister , let him do it as of the ability which God giveth : that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
As every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
But rejoice , inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings ; that , when his glory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
Beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you :

For he testifieth , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God ?
Yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this behalf .
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing , as unto a faithful Creator .
And if the righteous scarcely be saved , where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ?
Who is made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life .

Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman , The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people , when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot , and thy belly to swell ;
But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband , and if thou be defiled , and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband :
And the priest shall write these curses in a book , and he shall blot them out with the bitter water :
And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels , to make thy belly to swell , and thy thigh to rot : And the woman shall say , Amen , amen .
Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand , and shall wave the offering before the LORD , and offer it upon the altar :
And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
And when he hath made her to drink the water , then it shall come to pass , that , if she be defiled , and have done trespass against her husband , that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter , and her belly shall swell , and her thigh shall rot : and the woman shall be a curse among her people .
And the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
And if the woman be not defiled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself , and the fat of that which is torn with beasts , may be used in any other use : but ye shall in no wise eat of it .
For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast , of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD , even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people .
Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of fowl or of beast , in any of your dwellings .
Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings , that pertain unto the LORD , having his uncleanness upon him , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .

By a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
And having an high priest over the house of God ;
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; )
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works :
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins ,
But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries .

He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually .
For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which the LORD your God giveth you .
Ye shall utterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
And ye shall overthrow their altars , and break their pillars , and burn their groves with fire ; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
These are the statutes and judgments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it , all the days that ye live upon the earth .
And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and heave offerings of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks :
And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee .
Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God .
But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there , even unto his habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come :

These are the families of the Levites : the family of the Libnites , the family of the Hebronites , the family of the Mahlites , the family of the Mushites , the family of the Korathites . And Kohath begat Amram .
And they shall hearken to thy voice : and thou shalt come , thou and the elders of Israel , unto the king of Egypt , and ye shall say unto him , The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us : and now let us go , we beseech thee , three days' journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God .
And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go , no , not by a mighty hand .
And God said unto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : and he said , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you .

Go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , The LORD God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared unto me , saying , I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :

But every vow of a widow , and of her that is divorced , wherewith they have bound their souls , shall stand against her .
But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vow which she vowed , and that which she uttered with her lips , wherewith she bound her soul , of none effect : and the LORD shall forgive her .
And her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
And if she had at all an husband , when she vowed , or uttered ought out of her lips , wherewith she bound her soul ;
But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth ; not any of her vows , or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul , shall stand : and the LORD shall forgive her , because her father disallowed her .
And her father hear her vow , and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul , and her father shall hold his peace at her : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand .
If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD , and bind herself by a bond , being in her father's house in her youth ;
If a man vow a vow unto the LORD , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth .
And thou shalt set them in two rows , six on a row , upon the pure table before the LORD .
Whereby , when ye read , ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ )
Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men , as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit ;
That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs , and of the same body , and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel :
Whereof I was made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power .
For this cause I Paul , the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles ,
If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward :
How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery ; ( as I wrote afore in few words ,
Unto me , who am less than the least of all saints , is this grace given , that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ;
And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery , which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God , who created all things by Jesus Christ :
This month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
Your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats :

For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
Because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankful ; but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves :
And the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , He is dead .
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature :
And likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .

And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood , and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD , even before the vail .
As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering .
And the skin of the bullock , and all his flesh , with his head , and with his legs , and his inwards , and his dung ,

The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came , and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven .

Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel , which calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication ; and she repented not .
Behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
And he said unto them , This kind can come forth by nothing , but by prayer and fasting .
Command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .

And of some , that Elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .

And said , I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD , and he heard me ; out of the belly of hell cried I , and thou heardest my voice .
The waters compassed me about , even to the soul : the depth closed me round about , the weeds were wrapped about my head .
Then I said , I am cast out of thy sight ; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple .
When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD : and my prayer came in unto thee , into thine holy temple .

But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees , and the other Pharisees , he cried out in the council , Men and brethren , I am a Pharisee , the son of a Pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question .
Then said Paul , I wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
And they that stood by said , Revilest thou God's high priest ?
Then said Paul unto him , God shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law , and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
And Paul , earnestly beholding the council , said , Men and brethren , I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day .

And Festus said , King Agrippa , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
Let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him ,
No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge : for he taketh a man's life to pledge .

Wherefore I say unto you , All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men : but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
But I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .

O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .

And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ;
John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire :
Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
And they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more .
In that he saith , A new covenant , he hath made the first old . Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away .

Finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might .
Put on the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand .
Stand therefore , having your loins girt about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness ;
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
Above all , taking the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked .
And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God :
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints ;
And for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that I may open my mouth boldly , to make known the mystery of the gospel ,
And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face , as a man speaketh unto his friend . And he turned again into the camp : but his servant Joshua , the son of Nun , a young man , departed not out of the tabernacle .
And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rose up and worshipped , every man in his tent door .
And the LORD said unto Moses , I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken : for thou hast found grace in my sight , and I know thee by name .

And after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , which was a Jewess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ .
And as he reasoned of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come Felix trembled , and answered , Go thy way for this time ; when I have a convenient season , I will call for thee .
He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room : and Felix , willing to shew the Jews a pleasure , left Paul bound .
These are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter , and these she bare unto Jacob , even sixteen souls .
Brethren , my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is , that they might be saved .
For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God , but not according to knowledge .
For they being ignorant of God's righteousness , and going about to establish their own righteousness , have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God .
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth .
For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law , That the man which doeth those things shall live by them .
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise , Say not in thine heart , Who shall ascend into heaven ? ( that is , to bring Christ down from above : )
Or , Who shall descend into the deep ? ( that is , to bring up Christ again from the dead . )
And the city lieth foursquare , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the reed , twelve thousand furlongs . The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .

And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain , and shewed me that great city , the holy Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God ,
Having the glory of God : and her light was like unto a stone most precious , even like a jasper stone , clear as crystal ;
And the building of the wall of it was of jasper : and the city was pure gold , like unto clear glass .
And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones . The first foundation was jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , a chalcedony ; the fourth , an emerald ;
They , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into the pit , and the earth closed upon them : and they perished from among the congregation .
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ? And he said , If I find there forty and five , I will not destroy it .

And the LORD said , If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sakes .
And Abraham answered and said , Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord , which am but dust and ashes :
Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein ?
That be far from thee to do after this manner , to slay the righteous with the wicked : and that the righteous should be as the wicked , that be far from thee : Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right ?
And the men turned their faces from thence , and went toward Sodom : but Abraham stood yet before the LORD .
And Abraham drew near , and said , Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
And the LORD said , Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great , and because their sin is very grievous ;
I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , I will know .
But think on me when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house :
For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews : and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
And he answering said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends :
And Joseph answered and said , This is the interpretation thereof : The three baskets are three days :
Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
He saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? go and see . And when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes .
And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .

And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
And he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .

But he answered and said , Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
Then came his disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ?
Then answered Peter and said unto him , Declare unto us this parable .
Let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
Do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
And Jesus said , Are ye also yet without understanding ?
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies :
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man .
And when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty :
But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses .
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
As many as I love , I rebuke and chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent .
Go ye , get you straw where ye can find it : yet not ought of your work shall be diminished .
Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall go no more out : and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , which is new Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from my God : and I will write upon him my new name .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .

So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
Because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked :
And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write ; These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ;
I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot : I would thou wert cold or hot .
Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren ; the LORD is his inheritance , according as the LORD thy God promised him .
For I am persuaded , that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come ,
Nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
But God commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
Much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from wrath through him .
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
And not only so , but we glory in tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience ;
He that spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect ? It is God that justifieth .

And patience , experience ; and experience , hope :
Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us .

But if the LORD make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and swallow them up , with all that appertain unto them , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD .
Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil .
Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations , which I give unto you ,
And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in your solemn feasts , to make a sweet savour unto the LORD , of the herd , or of the flock :
And the rest , some on boards , and some on broken pieces of the ship . And so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
But the centurion , willing to save Paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
And falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .

Dare any of you , having a matter against another , go to law before the unjust , and not before the saints ?
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
Know ye not that we shall judge angels ? how much more things that pertain to this life ?

And leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :
Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee ;
Then the devil leaveth him , and , behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
Then saith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
From that time Jesus began to preach , and to say , Repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
The people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
The land of Zabulon , and the land of Nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ;
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying ,
But his bow abode in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob ; ( from thence is the shepherd , the stone of Israel : )
Even by the God of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the Almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lieth under , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb :
The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills : they shall be on the head of Joseph , and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren .
He is thy praise , and he is thy God , that hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thine eyes have seen .
Out of Asher his bread shall be fat , and he shall yield royal dainties .
And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years : and he begat sons and daughters :
So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . He that loveth his wife loveth himself .
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as the Lord the church :
The children of Gad after their families : of Zephon , the family of the Zephonites : of Haggi , the family of the Haggites : of Shuni , the family of the Shunites :
These are the families of the Simeonites , twenty and two thousand and two hundred .
Of Zerah , the family of the Zarhites : of Shaul , the family of the Shaulites .
Joseph is a fruitful bough , even a fruitful bough by a well ; whose branches run over the wall :
Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not .
And the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up together with Korah , when that company died , what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men : and they became a sign .
Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God .
Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the Lord .
For the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body .
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing .
Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it ;
That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word ,
That he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot , or wrinkle , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob , neither is there any divination against Israel : according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What hath God wrought !
Take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
For I know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
These be they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the Spirit .
How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walk after their own ungodly lusts .
But none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
And now , behold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more .
Wherefore I take you to record this day , that I am pure from the blood of all men .
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God .
And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house ,
Testifying both to the Jews , and also to the Greeks , repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
And now , behold , I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there :
Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
As it is written , Behold , I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence : and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed .
Wherefore ? Because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . For they stumbled at that stumblingstone ;
But Israel , which followed after the law of righteousness , hath not attained to the law of righteousness .
What shall we say then ? That the Gentiles , which followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith .
And the time drew nigh that Israel must die : and he called his son Joseph , and said unto him , If now I have found grace in thy sight , put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh , and deal kindly and truly with me ; bury me not , I pray thee , in Egypt :
Also regard not your stuff ; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours .
And the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment .
And to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
So he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way .
And they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father ,
And told him , saying , Joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt . And Jacob's heart fainted , for he believed them not .
And they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said unto them : and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob their father revived :
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
But I know him : for I am from him , and he hath sent me .
And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years , and begat a son :
And he called his name Noah , saying , This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands , because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed .
The people answered and said , Thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
Jesus answered and said unto them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel .
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he , whom they seek to kill ?
But , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ?
Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is .
And Jesus said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That ye which have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
And every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name's sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
And he said unto Moses , Come up unto the LORD , thou , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship ye afar off .
Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God , and of Jesus our Lord ,
And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
When his disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed , saying , Who then can be saved ?
But Jesus beheld them , and said unto them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible .
Then answered Peter and said unto him , Behold , we have forsaken all , and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore ?
The young man saith unto him , All these things have I kept from my youth up : what lack I yet ?
Jesus said unto him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
But when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions .
Then said Jesus unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth .
And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward come into the camp .
The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . But wisdom is justified of her children .
For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a devil .
And the bullock for the sin offering , and the goat for the sin offering , whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place , shall one carry forth without the camp ; and they shall burn in the fire their skins , and their flesh , and their dung .
He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , which was for to come .
And saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented .
But whereunto shall I liken this generation ? It is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows ,
Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
For this is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
Behold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and I say to her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water of thy pitcher to drink ;
And I came this day unto the well , and said , O LORD God of my master Abraham , if now thou do prosper my way which I go ;
Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath .
And he said unto me , The LORD , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father's house :
And I asked her , and said , Whose daughter art thou ? And she said , The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor's son , whom Milcah bare unto him : and I put the earring upon her face , and the bracelets upon her hands .
And she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
And before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and I said unto her , Let me drink , I pray thee .
And she say to me , Both drink thou , and I will also draw for thy camels : let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son .
And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me ; that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
And I bowed down my head , and worshipped the LORD , and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham , which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son .
And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation , and shall put off the linen garments , which he put on when he went into the holy place , and shall leave them there :
And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years : and he died .
And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat , and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel , and all their transgressions in all their sins , putting them upon the head of the goat , and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness :
And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , Great and marvellous are thy works , Lord God Almighty ; just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints .
What man soever there be of the house of Israel , that killeth an ox , or lamb , or goat , in the camp , or that killeth it out of the camp ,
Speak unto Aaron , and unto his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them ; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded , saying ,
But Balaam answered and said unto Balak , Told not I thee , saying , All that the LORD speaketh , that I must do ?
Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them .

Who , when they had examined me , would have let me go , because there was no cause of death in me .
And from thence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum , and The three taverns : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
Where we found brethren , and were desired to tarry with them seven days : and so we went toward Rome .
And it came to pass , that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together : and when they were come together , he said unto them , Men and brethren , though I have committed nothing against the people , or customs of our fathers , yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans .
And when we came to Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria , which had wintered in the isle , whose sign was Castor and Pollux .
Who also honoured us with many honours ; and when we departed , they laded us with such things as were necessary .
And from thence we fetched a compass , and came to Rhegium : and after one day the south wind blew , and we came the next day to Puteoli :
And landing at Syracuse , we tarried there three days .
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying ,
And this shall be a sign unto you ; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger .

And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
But Mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .

If there be found among you , within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee , man or woman , that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God , in transgressing his covenant ,
And Moses took the rod from before the LORD , as he commanded him .
But all other flying creeping things , which have four feet , shall be an abomination unto you .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife : it is thy brother's nakedness .
And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day .
And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought , which is not of the fields of his possession ;
Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation , even unto the year of the jubile : and he shall give thine estimation in that day , as a holy thing unto the LORD .
Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn , or of thy wine , or of thy oil , or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock , nor any of thy vows which thou vowest , nor thy freewill offerings , or heave offering of thine hand :
Even these of them ye may eat ; the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard , with the ensign of their father's house : far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch .
And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies : and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children of Judah .
But the field , when it goeth out in the jubile , shall be holy unto the LORD , as a field devoted ; the possession thereof shall be the priest's .
And his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and four thousand and four hundred .
Then the tribe of Zebulun : and Eliab the son of Helon shall be captain of the children of Zebulun .
And his host , and those that were numbered of them , were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred .
And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar : and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of the children of Issachar .
Only the firstling of the beasts , which should be the LORD's firstling , no man shall sanctify it ; whether it be ox , or sheep : it is the LORD's .
And his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred .
All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred , throughout their armies . These shall first set forth .
And if it be of an unclean beast , then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation , and shall add a fifth part of it thereto : or if it be not redeemed , then it shall be sold according to thy estimation .
In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .
And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary : twenty gerahs shall be the shekel .
Ye shall do no manner of work : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
And Isaac loved Esau , because he did eat of his venison : but Rebekah loved Jacob .
And Jacob sod pottage : and Esau came from the field , and he was faint :

And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day , the same soul will I destroy from among his people .
And the children struggled together within her ; and she said , If it be so , why am I thus ? And she went to inquire of the LORD .

And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife , because she was barren : and the LORD was intreated of him , and Rebekah his wife conceived .
And after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold on Esau's heel ; and his name was called Jacob : and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them .

If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within thy gates : then shalt thou arise , and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose ;
Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock , or sheep , wherein is blemish , or any evilfavouredness : for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God .
And hath gone and served other gods , and worshipped them , either the sun , or moon , or any of the host of heaven , which I have not commanded ;
Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD : on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD : it is a solemn assembly ; and ye shall do no servile work therein .
Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman , which have committed that wicked thing , unto thy gates , even that man or that woman , and shalt stone them with stones , till they die .
And it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people . So thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
At the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he that is worthy of death be put to death ; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land , ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days : on the first day shall be a sabbath , and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath .
Beside the sabbaths of the LORD , and beside your gifts , and beside all your vows , and beside all your freewill offerings , which ye give unto the LORD .
If the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods .

If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall restore double .
If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten , and shall put in his beast , and shall feed in another man's field ; of the best of his own field , and of the best of his own vineyard , shall he make restitution .
If a thief be found breaking up , and be smitten that he die , there shall no blood be shed for him .
If the sun be risen upon him , there shall be blood shed for him ; for he should make full restitution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sold for his theft .
These are the feasts of the LORD , which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations , to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD , a burnt offering , and a meat offering , a sacrifice , and drink offerings , every thing upon his day :
If a man shall steal an ox , or a sheep , and kill it , or sell it ; he shall restore five oxen for an ox , and four sheep for a sheep .
For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
Let your loins be girded about , and your lights burning ;
And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
But rather seek ye the kingdom of God ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
Fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
Sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
If ye walk in my statutes , and keep my commandments , and do them ;
And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
And this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .

For , lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour .

And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth .
And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?

And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand : that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and shew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers ;
And if a woman approach unto any beast , and lie down thereto , thou shalt kill the woman , and the beast : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
On the same day it shall be eaten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow : I am the LORD .
Therefore shall ye keep my commandments , and do them : I am the LORD .
And Mizraim begat Ludim , and Anamim , and Lehabim , and Naphtuhim ,
And Resen between Nineveh and Calah : the same is a great city .
Out of that land went forth Asshur , and builded Nineveh , and the city Rehoboth , and Calah ,
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel , and Erech , and Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
Which none of the princes of this world knew : for had they known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
But as it is written , Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him .
And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn , and Heth ,
And Pathrusim , and Casluhim , ( out of whom came Philistim , ) and Caphtorim .
And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , that come to nought :
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory :
And I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God .
For I determined not to know any thing among you , save Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
Is any man called being circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised . Is any called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
And unto the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife depart from her husband :
But and if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
But to the rest speak I , not the Lord : If any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
But if the unbelieving depart , let him depart . A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases : but God hath called us to peace .
For what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
But as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . And so ordain I in all churches .

And when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .

And when they were gone over , they came into the land of Gennesaret .
And when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto him all that were diseased ;
And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
And if a man take a wife and her mother , it is wickedness : they shall be burnt with fire , both he and they ; that there be no wickedness among you .

So when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .

And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean ; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even .

For ye were sometimes darkness , but now are ye light in the Lord : walk as children of light :
( For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ; )
Let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
Be not ye therefore partakers with them .
Neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not convenient : but rather giving of thanks .

Therefore to him that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin .

And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
For they are my servants , which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : they shall not be sold as bondmen .

But Festus , willing to do the Jews a pleasure , answered Paul , and said , Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ?
While he answered for himself , Neither against the law of the Jews , neither against the temple , nor yet against Caesar , have I offended any thing at all .

Not a novice , lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil .
Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
One that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all gravity ;
( For if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
A bishop then must be blameless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behaviour , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
Not given to wine , no striker , not greedy of filthy lucre ; but patient , not a brawler , not covetous ;

Likewise must the deacons be grave , not doubletongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ;
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .

To whom coming , as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and precious ,
Ye also , as lively stones , are built up a spiritual house , an holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture , Behold , I lay in Sion a chief corner stone , elect , precious : and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded .
Unto you therefore which believe he is precious : but unto them which be disobedient , the stone which the builders disallowed , the same is made the head of the corner ,
Wherefore laying aside all malice , and all guile , and hypocrisies , and envies , and all evil speakings ,
As newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby :
If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious .
And a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offence , even to them which stumble at the word , being disobedient : whereunto also they were appointed .
But ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
Be not deceived : evil communications corrupt good manners .

Behold now , I have two daughters which have not known man ; let me , I pray you , bring them out unto you , and do ye to them as is good in your eyes : only unto these men do nothing ; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof .
And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan , it shall be of fine flour unleavened , mingled with oil .
And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven , it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , or unleavened wafers anointed with oil .
And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
Thou shalt part it in pieces , and pour oil thereon : it is a meat offering .
And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren , Let me find grace in your eyes , and what ye shall say unto me I will give .
And ye shall dwell with us : and the land shall be before you ; dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possessions therein .
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully , and said , because he had defiled Dinah their sister :
And the men are shepherds , for their trade hath been to feed cattle ; and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have .
Ask me never so much dowry and gift , and I will give according as ye shall say unto me : but give me the damsel to wife .
The centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof : but speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed .
For I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
And Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .

When he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
And , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
And Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou clean . And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
And his disciples said unto him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
And Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , Who touched my clothes ?
And he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James .
As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe .
So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well ; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better .
The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sinneth not : let them marry .
Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
There is difference also between a wife and a virgin . The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit : but she that is married careth for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
But I would have you without carefulness . He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may please the Lord :
But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
And they that weep , as though they wept not ; and they that rejoice , as though they rejoiced not ; and they that buy , as though they possessed not ;
And they that use this world , as not abusing it : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
And if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God .
And Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
And when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals .
And his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told Jesus .
When Jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
And he sent , and beheaded John in the prison .
And his head was brought in a charger , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
And Peter went out , and wept bitterly .
And the men that held Jesus mocked him , and smote him .
And when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that smote thee ?
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
He said , Bring them hither to me .
Art thou the Christ ? tell us . And he said unto them , If I tell you , ye will not believe :
All the congregation of Israel shall keep it .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Behold , thy days approach that thou must die : call Joshua , and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation , that I may give him a charge . And Moses and Joshua went , and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation .
But your wives , and your little ones , and your cattle , ( for I know that ye have much cattle , ) shall abide in your cities which I have given you ;
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; for his seed remaineth in him : and he cannot sin , because he is born of God .
He that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
Behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not .
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
Beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins ; and in him is no sin .
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law : for sin is the transgression of the law .
Little children , let no man deceive you : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous .
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither known him .
And Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father's house , I will go up , and shew Pharaoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father's house , which were in the land of Canaan , are come unto me ;

And when Peter was come to himself , he said , Now I know of a surety , that the Lord hath sent his angel , and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod , and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews .
Who was delivered for our offences , and was raised again for our justification .
But for us also , to whom it shall be imputed , if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead ;
And when she knew Peter's voice , she opened not the gate for gladness , but ran in , and told how Peter stood before the gate .
And they said unto her , Thou art mad . But she constantly affirmed that it was even so . Then said they , It is his angel .
And being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
But he , beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace , declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . And he said , Go shew these things unto James , and to the brethren . And he departed , and went into another place .
And Pharaoh sent , and called for Moses and Aaron , and said unto them , I have sinned this time : the LORD is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .

And all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took Paul , and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
And the Horites in their mount Seir , unto El-paran , which is by the wilderness .
These are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations : and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar , Arioch king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer king of Elam , and Tidal king of nations ;
That these made war with Bera king of Sodom , and with Birsha king of Gomorrah , Shinab king of Admah , and Shemeber king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela , which is Zoar .
And as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
And the day following Paul went in with us unto James ; and all the elders were present .

Verily I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
Again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .

And immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone : and there was a rainbow round about the throne , in sight like unto an emerald .
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal : and in the midst of the throne , and round about the throne , were four beasts full of eyes before and behind .

Or crookbackt , or a dwarf , or that hath a blemish in his eye , or be scurvy , or scabbed , or hath his stones broken ;
No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire : he hath a blemish ; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God .

And one of the elders saith unto me , Weep not : behold , the Lion of the tribe of Juda , the Root of David , hath prevailed to open the book , and to loose the seven seals thereof .
And the law is not of faith : but , The man that doeth them shall live in them .
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written , Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God , it is evident : for , The just shall live by faith .
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made . He saith not , And to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , And to thy seed , which is Christ .
And this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , cannot disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .

Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
To an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for you ,
That the trial of your faith , being much more precious than of gold that perisheth , though it be tried with fire , might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ :
Wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a season , if need be , ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations :
Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
When thou buildest a new house , then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof , that thou bring not blood upon thine house , if any man fall from thence .

If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
Receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .

In like manner shalt thou do with his ass ; and so shalt thou do with his raiment ; and with all lost thing of thy brother's , which he hath lost , and thou hast found , shalt thou do likewise : thou mayest not hide thyself .
And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee , or if thou know him not , then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house , and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it , and thou shalt restore it to him again .
And they departed from Rithmah , and pitched at Rimmon-parez .

Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
Ye are the light of the world . A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid .

And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , In my dream , behold , I stood upon the bank of the river :
And Joseph answered Pharaoh , saying , It is not in me : God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace .
And we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
Pharaoh was wroth with his servants , and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house , both me and the chief baker :
And it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
And there was there with us a young man , an Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams ; to each man according to his dream he did interpret .

Is any among you afflicted ? let him pray . Is any merry ? let him sing psalms .
Take , my brethren , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , for an example of suffering affliction , and of patience .
Behold , we count them happy which endure . Ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
Confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .

Not purloining , but shewing all good fidelity ; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things .
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men ,
Teaching us that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we should live soberly , righteously , and godly , in this present world ;
Looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ ;
Who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify unto himself a peculiar people , zealous of good works .
These things speak , and exhort , and rebuke with all authority . Let no man despise thee .

Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger : for ye know the heart of a stranger , seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt .

Thou shalt not raise a false report : put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness .
Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause .
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil ; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment :
If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , and wouldest forbear to help him , thou shalt surely help with him .

Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land which I give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD .

And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
And for thy cattle , and for the beast that are in thy land , shall all the increase thereof be meat .
But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the LORD : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .

And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron , Because ye believed me not , to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them .
And I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .

And all the tithe of the land , whether of the seed of the land , or of the fruit of the tree , is the LORD's : it is holy unto the LORD .
Remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
Six days shalt thou labour , and do all thy work :
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live .
And God spake all these words , saying ,
I am the LORD thy God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
Thou shalt have no other gods before me .
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them : for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ;
And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me , and keep my commandments .
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain ; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .

Blind , or broken , or maimed , or having a wen , or scurvy , or scabbed , ye shall not offer these unto the LORD , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD .
Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever .
Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite ; for he is thy brother : thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian ; because thou wast a stranger in his land .

And he went into the synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three months , disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God .

And when Paul had laid his hands upon them , the Holy Ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongues , and prophesied .

Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
When therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
But he spake of the temple of his body .
Then said the Jews , Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?

And whether it be cow or ewe , ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day .
And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse ; Reuben , Gad , and Asher , and Zebulun , Dan , and Naphtali .
And they presented the burnt offering unto him , with the pieces thereof , and the head : and he burnt them upon the altar .
And he slew the burnt offering ; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled round about upon the altar .
But Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
And he brought the meat offering , and took an handful thereof , and burnt it upon the altar , beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning .
And he brought the burnt offering , and offered it according to the manner .
And he brought the people's offering , and took the goat , which was the sin offering for the people , and slew it , and offered it for sin , as the first .
And he did wash the inwards and the legs , and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar .
And the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
And Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answering said unto him , Thou sayest it .
And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council , and bound Jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him to Pilate .
He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled upon the altar round about ,

Be not ye therefore like unto them : for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
After this manner therefore pray ye : Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name .
But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
That thine alms may be in secret : and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly .
And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
Therefore when thou doest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven .
And there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors .
But ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
For whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but I am among you as he that serveth .
Likewise also the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood , which is shed for you .
But , behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
And truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
And they began to inquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations .
And I appoint unto you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed unto me ;
And Moses said unto Hobab , the son of Raguel the Midianite , Moses' father in law , We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said , I will give it you : come thou with us , and we will do thee good : for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel .
Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies , when they set forward .
For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance .
As concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your sakes : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the fathers' sakes .
And he made his seven lamps , and his snuffers , and his snuffdishes , of pure gold .
For if God spared not the natural branches , take heed lest he also spare not thee .
Well ; because of unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by faith . Be not highminded , but fear :
And they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be graffed in : for God is able to graff them in again .
Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
For I would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conceits ; that blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in .
For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be graffed into their own olive tree ?
For this is my covenant unto them , when I shall take away their sins .
And so all Israel shall be saved : as it is written , There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob :
But God , who is rich in mercy , for his great love wherewith he loved us ,
And he overlaid it with pure gold , both the top of it , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns of it : also he made unto it a crown of gold round about .
He that smiteth a man , so that he die , shall be surely put to death .
Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience :
And if a man lie not in wait , but God deliver him into his hand ; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
Of a talent of pure gold made he it , and all the vessels thereof .
And when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh , saying , If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pray you , in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
Thou shalt not see the brother's ox or his sheep go astray , and hide thyself from them : thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother .
Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Thou art permitted to speak for thyself . Then Paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself :
I think myself happy , king Agrippa , because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews :
Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently .
My manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem , know all the Jews ;
Which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers :
Unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving God day and night , hope to come . For which hope's sake , king Agrippa , I am accused of the Jews .
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you , that God should raise the dead ?
I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
Now then it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
If then I do that which I would not , I consent unto the law that it is good .
For that which I do I allow not : for what I would , that do I not ; but what I hate , that do I .
For we know that the law is spiritual : but I am carnal , sold under sin .
Was then that which is good made death unto me ? God forbid . But sin , that it might appear sin , working death in me by that which is good ; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
Wherefore the law is holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good .
For sin , taking occasion by the commandment , deceived me , and by it slew me .
And the commandment , which was ordained to life , I found to be unto death .
For the word of God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
For the good that I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , that I do .
For I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh , ) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
That thou mayest love the LORD thy God , and that thou mayest obey his voice , and that thou mayest cleave unto him : for he is thy life , and the length of thy days : that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give them .
And he said , I heard thy voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself .
And Pharaoh said , Go up , and bury thy father , according as he made thee swear .
And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
And Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses , whom the LORD knew face to face ,
And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath , that the net may be even to the midst of the altar .
And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass ; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof .
And the staves shall be put into the rings , and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar , to bear it .
And I wept much , because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book , neither to look thereon .
And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood , five cubits long , and five cubits broad ; the altar shall be foursquare : and the height thereof shall be three cubits .
And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes , and his shovels , and his basons , and his fleshhooks , and his firepans : all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass .
And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof : his horns shall be of the same : and thou shalt overlay it with brass .
And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle : for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side :
Hollow with boards shalt thou make it : as it was shewed thee in the mount , so shall they make it .
And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it .
And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathen work of pure gold .
And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold , and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate .
And the fourth row a beryl , and an onyx , and a jasper : they shall be set in gold in their inclosings .
And when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
But I determined this with myself , that I would not come again to you in heaviness .
And I wrote this same unto you , lest , when I came , I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
For if I make you sorry , who is he then that maketh me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
But if any have caused grief , he hath not grieved me , but in part : that I may not overcharge you all .
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears ; not that ye should be grieved , but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you .
So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him , and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment , which was inflicted of many .
For to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him .
And it came to pass , that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharoah that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
And the children of Israel went away , and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses .
And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod .
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side posts , the LORD will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you .
And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .

And it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , What mean ye by this service ?
And it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
Now I say , That the heir , as long as he is a child , differeth nothing from a servant , though he be lord of all ;

Even so we , when we were children , were in bondage under the elements of the world :
But when the fulness of the time was come , God sent forth his Son , made of a woman , made under the law ,
To redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
And because ye are sons , God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , crying , Abba , Father .
Wherefore thou art no more a servant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir of God through Christ .
Howbeit then , when ye knew not God , ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods .
But now , after that ye have known God , or rather are known of God , how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements , whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage ?

And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards .
And their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
The length of a board was ten cubits , and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half .
And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood , standing up .
And he made boards for the tabernacle ; twenty boards for the south side southward :
One board had two tenons , equally distant one from another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
The brasen altar , and his grate of brass , his staves , and all his vessels , the laver and his foot ,
And the golden altar , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the tabernacle door ,
And they were coupled beneath , and coupled together at the head thereof , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners .
And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides .
And there was great joy in that city .
But there was a certain man , called Simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :

As for Saul , he made havock of the church , entering into every house , and haling men and women committed them to prison .
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word .

And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem , unto the plain of Moreh . And the Canaanite was then in the land .

Distributing to the necessity of saints ; given to hospitality .
Rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation ; continuing instant in prayer ;

Now if any man build upon this foundation gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble ;
Recompense to no man evil for evil . Provide things honest in the sight of all men .
For I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :

When Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
Philip answered him , Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little .
And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timotheus our brother ,
Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence : and likewise also the wife unto the husband .
We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fed thee ? or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven , whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ;
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which ye have to all the saints ,
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant , who is for you a faithful minister of Christ ;
Nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
For this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ;
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
That the land spue not you out also , when ye defile it , as it spued out the nations that were before you .

When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem ,
And they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
So they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .

Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD , of all the best thereof , even the hallowed part thereof out of it .
God also bearing them witness , both with signs and wonders , and with divers miracles , and gifts of the Holy Ghost , according to his own will ?
And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you , as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor , and as the fulness of the winepress .

Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard , lest at any time we should let them slip .
And beside this , giving all diligence , add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue knowledge ;
How shall we escape , if we neglect so great salvation ; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord , and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him ;
And they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .
And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .

Charity never faileth : but whether there be prophecies , they shall fail ; whether there be tongues , they shall cease ; whether there be knowledge , it shall vanish away .
For we know in part , and we prophesy in part .
Rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth ;
Beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
Charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ,
Doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil ;
And though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing .
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and have not charity , I am become as sounding brass , or a tinkling cymbal .

Send therefore to Joppa , and call hither Simon , whose surname is Peter ; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side : who , when he cometh , shall speak unto thee .
Immediately therefore I sent to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come . Now therefore are we all here present before God , to hear all things that are commanded thee of God .
Then Peter opened his mouth , and said , Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons :
But in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is accepted with him .
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Jesus Christ : ( he is Lord of all : )
That word , I say , ye know , which was published throughout all Judaea , and began from Galilee , after the baptism which John preached ;

As also the high priest doth bear me witness , and all the estate of the elders : from whom also I received letters unto the brethren , and went to Damascus , to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem , for to be punished .

And I fell unto the ground , and heard a voice saying unto me , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ?
Men , brethren , and fathers , hear ye my defence which I make now unto you .
( And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith , )
I am verily a man which am a Jew , born in Tarsus , a city in Cilicia , yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel , and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers , and was zealous toward God , as ye all are this day .
Now I rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye sorrowed to repentance : for ye were made sorry after a godly manner , that ye might receive damage by us in nothing .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
And Jesus answered and said unto her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things :
Jesus saith unto him , Rise , take up thy bed , and walk .

After this there was a feast of the Jews ; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches .
In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
And a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years .
When Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
The impotent man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me .
And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham :
And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward :
And the border shall go down to Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about .
Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,

Only the gold , and the silver , the brass , the iron , the tin , and the lead ,
And he shall take away all the fat thereof , as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings ; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him , and it shall be forgiven him .
Every thing that may abide the fire , ye shall make it go through the fire , and it shall be clean : nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation : and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water .
And purify all your raiment , and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats' hair , and all things made of wood .

O ye Corinthians , our mouth is open unto you , our heart is enlarged .
And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living God ; as God hath said , I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
Wherefore come out from among them , and be ye separate , saith the Lord , and touch not the unclean thing ; and I will receive you ,
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers : for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? and what communion hath light with darkness ?
And what concord hath Christ with Belial ? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel ?
Not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing : but contrariwise blessing ; knowing that ye are thereunto called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
Finally , be ye all of one mind , having compassion one of another , love as brethren , be pitiful , be courteous :
Likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
Even as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amazement .

While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear .
Likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;

For all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .

An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings , and thy peace offerings , thy sheep , and thine oxen : in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee , and I will bless thee .

We are fools for Christ's sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honourable , but we are despised .
Being defamed , we intreat : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
And labour , working with our own hands : being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it :

That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;

If we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :
This then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
And these things write we unto you , that your joy may be full .
It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .

For ye , brethren , became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus : for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen , even as they have of the Jews :
Who both killed the Lord Jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not God , and are contrary to all men :
Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved , to fill up their sins alway : for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost .

Verily , verily , I say unto you , If a man keep my saying , he shall never see death .
Then said the Jews unto him , Now we know that thou hast a devil . Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , If a man keep my saying , he shall never taste of death .
Art thou greater than our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
Jesus answered , If I honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my Father that honoureth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God :
Yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it , and was glad .
Then said the Jews unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ .
And of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace .
John bare witness of him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spake , He that cometh after me is preferred before me : for he was before me .
And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
Which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
But as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
He came unto his own , and his own received him not .
He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
And this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ?
No man hath seen God at any time ; the only begotten Son , which is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him .
Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things do ye .
And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ;
But ye say , If a man shall say to his father or mother , It is Corban , that is to say , a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ; he shall be free .
For Moses said , Honour thy father and thy mother ; and , Whoso curseth father or mother , let him die the death :
And when he was entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
There is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
And when he had called all the people unto him , he said unto them , Hearken unto me every one of you , and understand :
Because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all meats ?
And he saith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ? Do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man , it cannot defile him ;
For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar , there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse .
And when he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
So likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ?
Which was the son of Aminadab , which was the son of Aram , which was the son of Esrom , which was the son of Phares , which was the son of Juda ,
And even things without life giving sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
But charge Joshua , and encourage him , and strengthen him : for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see .
So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor .
When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field , and hast forgot a sheaf in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands .
Now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
Ye shall not fear them : for the LORD your God he shall fight for you .
And I besought the LORD at that time , saying ,
And do ye abide without the camp seven days : whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
And I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings : so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest .
But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes , and would not hear me : and the LORD said unto me , Let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto me of this matter .
I would that ye all spake with tongues , but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
O Lord GOD , thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy mighty hand : for what God is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to thy works , and according to thy might ?
I pray thee , let me go over , and see the good land that is beyond Jordan , that goodly mountain , and Lebanon .
He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself ; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church .
But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification , and exhortation , and comfort .
And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother . And all the people shall say , Amen .
For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men , but unto God : for no man understandeth him ; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
Follow after charity , and desire spiritual gifts , but rather that ye may prophesy .
And when the LORD saw it , he abhorred them , because of the provoking of his sons , and of his daughters .
And God spake unto Noah , and to his sons with him , saying ,
And I , behold , I establish my covenant with you , and with your seed after you ;
Whoso sheddeth man's blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of God made he man .
And you , be ye fruitful , and multiply ; bring forth abundantly in the earth , and multiply therein .
But flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
And surely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every beast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man .
And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth , and upon every fowl of the air , upon all that moveth upon the earth , and upon all the fishes of the sea ; into your hand are they delivered .
Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things .
And God blessed Noah and his sons , and said unto them , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God , and serve him , and shalt swear by his name .
Now these are the generations of Esau , who is Edom .
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan ; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ;
And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter , sister of Nebajoth .
And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz ; and Bashemath bare Reuel ;
And Aholibamah bare Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah : these are the sons of Esau , which were born unto him in the land of Canaan .
And Esau took his wives , and his sons , and his daughters , and all the persons of his house , and his cattle , and all his beasts , and all his substance , which he had got in the land of Canaan ; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob .
For their riches were more than that they might dwell together ; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle .
Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir : Esau is Edom .
And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir :
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father , and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?
Then said Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
And , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest's , and smote off his ear .
And Jesus said unto him , Friend , wherefore art thou come ? Then came they , and laid hands on Jesus , and took him .
And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
But all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
Now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against Jesus , to put him to death ;
But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias . And when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written ,
And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
And in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
For it is written , He shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee :
And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season .
And Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
To preach the acceptable year of the Lord .
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised ,
And thou shalt gird them with girdles , Aaron and his sons , and put the bonnets on them : and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute : and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons .
And thou shalt bring his sons , and put coats upon them .
And thou shalt put them into one basket , and bring them in the basket , with the bullock and the two rams .
And unleavened bread , and cakes unleavened tempered with oil , and wafers unleavened anointed with oil : of wheaten flour shalt thou make them .
And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them , to minister unto me in the priest's office : Take one young bullock , and two rams without blemish ,
Then shalt thou take the anointing oil , and pour it upon his head , and anoint him .
And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head , and put the holy crown upon the mitre .
And thou shalt take the garments , and put upon Aaron the coat , and the robe of the ephod , and the ephod , and the breastplate , and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod :
And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and shalt wash them with water .
These were the numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty .
And the LORD said unto him , Away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and Aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD , lest he break forth upon them .
And let the priests also , which come near to the LORD , sanctify themselves , lest the LORD break forth upon them .
And Moses said unto the LORD , The people cannot come up to mount Sinai : for thou chargedst us , saying , Set bounds about the mount , and sanctify it .
And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Go down , charge the people , lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze , and many of them perish .
And you , being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh , hath he quickened together with him , having forgiven you all trespasses ;
Buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ :
And ye are complete in him , which is the head of all principality and power :
And one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ?
And Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is , Hear , O Israel ; The Lord our God is one Lord :
And having spoiled principalities and powers , he made a shew of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ;
And Jesus answering said unto them , Do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of God ?
For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels which are in heaven .
And as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spake unto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
He is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err .
Now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed .
And the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise .
And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also .
In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
Have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
Have we not power to eat and to drink ?
Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
Or I only and Barnabas , have not we power to forbear working ?
Am I not an apostle ? am I not free ? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord ? are not ye my work in the Lord ?
Mine answer to them that do examine me is this ,
If I be not an apostle unto others , yet doubtless I am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord .
For it is written in the law of Moses , Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn . Doth God take care for oxen ?
Say I these things as a man ? or saith not the law the same also ?
And he said unto them , Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as the LORD shall speak unto me : and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam .
And God came unto Balaam , and said , What men are these with thee ?
There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples .
Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing . They say unto him , We also go with thee . They went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias ; and on this wise shewed he himself .
And he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord . Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his fisher's coat unto him , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea .
But when the morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
Then Jesus saith unto them , Children , have ye any meat ? They answered him , No .
And the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
As soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
Strive to enter in at the strait gate : for many , I say unto you , will seek to enter in , and shall not be able .
And it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the LORD his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them :
And those members of the body , which we think to be less honourable , upon these we bestow more abundant honour ; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness .
Nay , much more those members of the body , which seem to be more feeble , are necessary :
And the eye cannot say unto the hand , I have no need of thee : nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
But now are they many members , yet but one body .
Now ye are the body of Christ , and members in particular .
And whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or one member be honoured , all the members rejoice with it .
That there should be no schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
For our comely parts have no need : but God hath tempered the body together , having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked :
Are all apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? are all workers of miracles ?
And God hath set some in the church , first apostles , secondarily prophets , thirdly teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , governments , diversities of tongues .
And men were scorched with great heat , and blasphemed the name of God , which hath power over these plagues : and they repented not to give him glory .
And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
And the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels , Go your ways , and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth .
And I heard another out of the altar say , Even so , Lord God Almighty , true and righteous are thy judgments .
For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets , and thou hast given them blood to drink ; for they are worthy .
And I heard the angel of the waters say , Thou art righteous , O Lord , which art , and wast , and shalt be , because thou hast judged thus .
And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters ; and they became blood .
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfil the lusts thereof .
The night is far spent , the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armour of light .
Let us walk honestly , as in the day ; not in rioting and drunkenness , not in chambering and wantonness , not in strife and envying .
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour : therefore love is the fulfilling of the law .
And that , knowing the time , that now it is high time to awake out of sleep : for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed .
For the LORD thy God blesseth thee , as he promised thee : and thou shalt lend unto many nations , but thou shalt not borrow ; and thou shalt reign over many nations , but they shall not reign over thee .
And to this agree the words of the prophets ; as it is written ,
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
That the residue of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Gentiles , upon whom my name is called , saith the Lord , who doeth all these things .
After this I will return , and will build again the tabernacle of David , which is fallen down ; and I will build again the ruins thereof , and I will set it up :
But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved , even as they .
Now therefore why tempt ye God , to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
And after they had held their peace , James answered , saying , Men and brethren , hearken unto me :
Then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
Wherefore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the Gentiles are turned to God :
Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world .
But Philip was found at Azotus : and passing through he preached in all the cities , till he came to Caesarea .
I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep .
The thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
The hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
But he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
As the Father knoweth me , even so know I the Father : and I lay down my life for the sheep .
I am the good shepherd , and know my sheep , and am known of mine .
Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again .
And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd .
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings .
No man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This commandment have I received of my Father .
And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
It is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . Every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me .
No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father .
The Jews then murmured at him , because he said , I am the bread which came down from heaven .
And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves .
And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , I came down from heaven ?
And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be unclean until the even .
And every garment , and every skin , whereon is the seed of copulation , shall be washed with water , and be unclean until the even .
And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and give them unto the priest :
And the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue .
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
I am that bread of life .
And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even : and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
And he said , Cast it on the ground . And he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from before it .
And Judas Iscariot , which also betrayed him : and they went into an house .
And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Canaanite ,
And James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James ; and he surnamed them Boanerges , which is , The sons of thunder :
And Simon he surnamed Peter ;
And to have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out devils :
And he ordained twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
And he goeth up into a mountain , and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him .
And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known .
And unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
For he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you , and ye shall afflict your souls , by a statute for ever .
But he hanged the chief baker : as Joseph had interpreted to them .
Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel :
Wherein I suffer trouble , as an evil doer , even unto bonds ; but the word of God is not bound .
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier .
And if a man also strive for masteries , yet is he not crowned , except he strive lawfully .
The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits .
Consider what I say ; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things .
Thou therefore , my son , be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
Thou therefore endure hardness , as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you , to cleanse you , that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD .
But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the Levite that is within thy gates : and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto .
Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer , while his heart is hot , and overtake him , because the way is long , and slay him ; whereas he was not worthy of death , inasmuch as he hated him not in time past .
As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood , and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree , and the head slippeth from the helve , and lighteth upon his neighbour , that he die ; he shall flee unto one of those cities , and live :
And it shall be , when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give thee great and goodly cities , which thou buildedst not ,
And houses full of all good things , which thou filledst not , and wells digged , which thou diggedst not , vineyards and olive trees , which thou plantedst not ; when thou shalt have eaten and be full ;
And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
And one kid of the goats , to make an atonement for you .
Ye shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the people which are round about you ;
( For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you ) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God , as ye tempted him in Massah .
Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers ,
To cast out all thine enemies from before thee , as the LORD hath spoken .
And the Amorites , which dwelt in that mountain , came out against you , and chased you , as bees do , and destroyed you in Seir , even unto Hormah .
And ye returned and wept before the LORD ; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice , nor give ear unto you .
And the LORD said unto me , Say unto them , Go not up , neither fight ; for I am not among you ; lest ye be smitten before your enemies .
So I spake unto you ; and ye would not hear , but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD , and went presumptuously up into the hill .
But as for you , turn you , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea .
Then ye answered and said unto me , We have sinned against the LORD , we will go up and fight , according to all that the LORD our God commanded us . And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war , ye were ready to go up into the hill .
And the priest , whom he shall anoint , and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead , shall make the atonement , and shall put on the linen clothes , even the holy garments :
And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ?
( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria . )
In the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , ye shall eat unleavened bread , until the one and twentieth day of the month at even .
And the children of Israel set forward , and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho .
And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
And Moab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
And Moab said unto the elders of Midian , Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field . And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time .
He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor , which is by the river of the land of the children of his people , to call him , saying , Behold , there is a people come out from Egypt : behold , they cover the face of the earth , and they abide over against me :
Come now therefore , I pray thee , curse me this people ; for they are too mighty for me : peradventure I shall prevail , that we may smite them , and that I may drive them out of the land : for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed , and he whom thou cursest is cursed .
And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
And it came to pass , when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . And he told Laban all these things .
And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother , and that he was Rebekah's son : and she ran and told her father .
But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel .
How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ?
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust .
For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me : for he wrote of me .

Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort ;
Who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ .
And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
And our hope of you is stedfast , knowing , that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation .
For we would not , brethren , have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure , above strength , insomuch that we despaired even of life :

Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
This is the service of the families of the Gershonites , to serve , and for burdens :
Lie not one to another , seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds ;
But now ye also put off all these ; anger , wrath , malice , blasphemy , filthy communication out of your mouth .
For ye are dead , and your life is hid with Christ in God .
Set your affection on things above , not on things on the earth .
If ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God .
In the which ye also walked some time , when ye lived in them .
For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience :

And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye .
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :

But they cried , saying , Crucify him , crucify him .
Pilate therefore , willing to release Jesus , spake again to them .
Therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye stedfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord .
For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
Behold , I shew you a mystery ; We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed ,
Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .

The enemy said , I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfied upon them ; I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them .
Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea : his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea .
The depths have covered them : they sank into the bottom as a stone .
Thy right hand , O LORD , is become glorious in power : thy right hand , O LORD , hath dashed in pieces the enemy .
And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD , and spake , saying , I will sing unto the LORD , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
The LORD is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation ; my father's God , and I will exalt him .
The LORD is a man of war : the LORD is his name .
And they shall know that I am the LORD their God , that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may dwell among them : I am the LORD their God .
And I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will be their God .
And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation , and the altar : I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons , to minister to me in the priest's office .
And there I will meet with the children of Israel , and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory .
This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD : where I will meet you , to speak there unto thee .
And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even , and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning , and according to the drink offering thereof , for a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil ; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering .
Then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
Then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead .
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep .
But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
These things said he : and after that he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep .
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off :
And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
But Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
And whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all .
For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
And many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , Thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee .
And he said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
And , behold , one came and said unto him , Good Master , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ?
And so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau , when ye find him .
Then thou shalt say , They be thy servant Jacob's ; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau : and , behold , also he is behind us .
And he commanded the foremost , saying , When Esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , saying , Whose art thou ? and whither goest thou ? and whose are these before thee ?
But he said unto them , All men cannot receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
Thirty milch camels with their colts , forty kine , and ten bulls , twenty she asses , and ten foals .
Two hundred she goats , and twenty he goats , two hundred ewes , and twenty rams ,
And he lodged there that same night ; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother ;
And thou saidst , I will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which cannot be numbered for multitude .
Deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
And wheresoever he taketh him , he teareth him : and he foameth , and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
And straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the Levite that is within thy gates , and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that are among you , in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there .
And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
And he said unto them , Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel , or under a bed ? and not to be set on a candlestick ?
And he asked the scribes , What question ye with them ?
Honour thy father and thy mother : and , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
He saith unto him , Which ? Jesus said , Thou shalt do no murder , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness ,
And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem .
But I say unto you , That Elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
But all that heard him were amazed , and said ; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem , and came hither for that intent , that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues , that he is the Son of God .
And after that many days were fulfilled , the Jews took counsel to kill him :
And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
Then the disciples took him by night , and let him down by the wall in a basket .
But their laying await was known of Saul . And they watched the gates day and night to kill him .
But Barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle , and had anointed it , and sanctified it , and all the instruments thereof , both the altar and all the vessels thereof , and had anointed them , and sanctified them ;
And they brought their offering before the LORD , six covered wagons , and twelve oxen ; a wagon for two of the princes , and for each one an ox : and they brought them before the tabernacle .
That the princes of Israel , heads of the house of their fathers , who were the princes of the tribes , and were over them that were numbered , offered :
Take it of them , that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation ; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites , to every man according to his service .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon , according to their service :
And Moses took the wagons and the oxen , and gave them unto the Levites .
But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none : because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders .
And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp .
Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said , We ought to obey God rather than men .
Saying , Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and , behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man's blood upon us .
Then came one and told them , saying , Behold , the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple , and teaching the people .
Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things , they doubted of them whereunto this would grow .
And when they had brought them , they set them before the council : and the high priest asked them ,
Then went the captain with the officers , and brought them without violence : for they feared the people , lest they should have been stoned .
And when they heard that , they entered into the temple early in the morning , and taught . But the high priest came , and they that were with him , and called the council together , and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought .
Go , stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life .
Saying , The prison truly found we shut with all safety , and the keepers standing without before the doors : but when we had opened , we found no man within .
But when the officers came , and found them not in the prison , they returned , and told ,
But the fat , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver of the sin offering , he burnt upon the altar ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD , ye shall offer it at your own will .
Turn ye not unto idols , nor make to yourselves molten gods : I am the LORD your God .
And if it be eaten at all on the third day , it is abominable ; it shall not be accepted .
It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it , and on the morrow : and if ought remain until the third day , it shall be burnt in the fire .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
Ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sabbaths : I am the LORD your God .
Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , and say unto them , Ye shall be holy : for I the LORD your God am holy .
And when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
And the swine , because it divideth the hoof , yet cheweth not the cud , it is unclean unto you : ye shall not eat of their flesh , nor touch their dead carcase .
These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters : all that have fins and scales shall ye eat :
Ye are the children of the LORD your God : ye shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God , and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing .
These are the beasts which ye shall eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
And they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
And every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claws , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the cloven hoof ; as the camel , and the hare , and the coney : for they chew the cud , but divide not the hoof ; therefore they are unclean unto you .
Come , see a man , which told me all things that ever I did : is not this the Christ ?
The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
And for these ye shall be unclean : whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even .
Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was , JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS .
Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father .
Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the Jews .
And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar's friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
God is a Spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth .
And upon this came his disciples , and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , What seekest thou ? or , Why talkest thou with her ?
Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people , as he hath promised thee , and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments ;
And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made , in praise , and in name , and in honour ; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God , as he hath spoken .
And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand , which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God , according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee :
Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and to hearken unto his voice :
I have not eaten thereof in my mourning , neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use , nor given ought thereof for the dead : but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God , and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me .
Look down from thy holy habitation , from heaven , and bless thy people Israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou swarest unto our fathers , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year , which is the year of tithing , and hast given it unto the Levite , the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , that they may eat within thy gates , and be filled ;
Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God , I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house , and also have given them unto the Levite , and unto the stranger , to the fatherless , and to the widow , according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me : I have not transgressed thy commandments , neither have I forgotten them :
And now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , O LORD , hast given me . And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God , and worship before the LORD thy God :
And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is among you .
God brought them out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn .
These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth ; the weasel , and the mouse , and the tortoise after his kind ,
And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : they are unclean unto you .
But the men that went up with him said , We be not able to go up against the people ; for they are stronger than we .
And Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , Let us go up at once , and possess it ; for we are well able to overcome it .
And there we saw the giants , the sons of Anak , which come of the giants : and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so we were in their sight .
And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel , saying , The land , through which we have gone to search it , is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof ; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature .
And ye shall perish among the heathen , and the land of your enemies shall eat you up .
Separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may consume them in a moment .
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And they fell upon their faces , and said , O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation ?
And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram ; and the elders of Israel followed him .
Speak unto the congregation , saying , Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram .
But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the Lord's body .
For as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do shew the Lord's death till he come .
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
And when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , Take , eat : this is my body , which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of me .
Then he said unto them , O fools , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken :
What ? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? or despise ye the church of God , and shame them that have not ? What shall I say to you ? shall I praise you in this ? I praise you not .
For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you , That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread :
When ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord's supper .
But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
Quench not the Spirit .
In every thing give thanks : for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you .
Wherefore comfort yourselves together , and edify one another , even as also ye do .
Who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake . And be at peace among yourselves .
And we beseech you , brethren , to know them which labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ;
See that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
Now we exhort you , brethren , warn them that are unruly , comfort the feebleminded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
Pray without ceasing .
Rejoice evermore .
And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest :
( For those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : )
For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of : but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
But this man , because he continueth ever , hath an unchangeable priesthood .
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
For such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
Who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people's : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her .
Behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give unto them and to their seed after them .

And Moses said unto them , If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan , every man armed to battle , before the LORD , and the land shall be subdued before you ; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession :
And Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Juda ;
But thy servants will pass over , every man armed for war , before the LORD to battle , as my lord saith .
Our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our cattle , shall be there in the cities of Gilead :
And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses , saying , Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth .
Build you cities for your little ones , and folds for your sheep ; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth .
But if ye will not do so , behold , ye have sinned against the LORD : and be sure your sin will find you out .
And he that killeth a beast shall make it good ; beast for beast .
And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD , until he hath driven out his enemies from before him ,
And Moses said unto them , If ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the LORD to war ,
These words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
Therefore said his parents , He is of age ; ask him .
His parents answered them and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
But by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
Then said they to him again , What did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
He answered them , I have told you already , and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ?
Then again called they the man that was blind , and said unto him , Give God the praise : we know that this man is a sinner .
He answered and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see .
And the fat of the bullock and of the ram , the rump , and that which covereth the inwards , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver :
Then they reviled him , and said , Thou art his disciple ; but we are Moses' disciples .
We know that God spake unto Moses : as for this fellow , we know not from whence he is .
And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
And they put him in ward , that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them .
And Balak offered oxen and sheep , and sent to Balaam , and to the princes that were with him .
And it came to pass on the morrow , that Balak took Balaam , and brought him up into the high places of Baal , that thence he might see the utmost part of the people .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And the son of an Israelitish woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp ;
That they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods ; so should ye sin against the LORD your God .
And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD , and cursed . And they brought him unto Moses : ( and his mother's name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan : )
And I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
And the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
And Noah begat three sons , Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand toward heaven , that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt , even darkness which may be felt .
Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the church which is in his house .
And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the holy city , and from the things which are written in this book .
For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book :
And Moses said , Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God .
And Pharaoh called unto Moses , and said , Go ye , serve the LORD ; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed : let your little ones also go with you .
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart , and he would not let them go .
Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas , greet you .
I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , the first and the last .
And , behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give every man according as his work shall be .
He that is unjust , let him be unjust still : and he which is filthy , let him be filthy still : and he that is righteous , let him be righteous still : and he that is holy , let him be holy still .
And he saith unto me , Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book : for the time is at hand .
And the Spirit and the bride say , Come . And let him that heareth say , Come . And let him that is athirst come . And whosoever will , let him take the water of life freely .
I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches . I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star .
For without are dogs , and sorcerers , and whoremongers , and murderers , and idolaters , and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie .
Blessed are they that do his commandments , that they may have right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
Brethren , the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
The earth also was corrupt before God , and the earth was filled with violence .
Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand .
As we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised ; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
But God forbid that I should glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom the world is crucified unto me , and I unto the world .
From henceforth let no man trouble me : for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus .
And as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
And I will bring the land into desolation : and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it .
And I will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you : and your land shall be desolate , and your cities waste .

But as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven .
And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
Then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .

Master , which is the great commandment in the law ?
The sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before that great and notable day of the Lord come :
And it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved .
Ye men of Israel , hear these words ; Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs , which God did by him in the midst of you , as ye yourselves also know :
Him , being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God , ye have taken , and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
Whom God hath raised up , having loosed the pains of death : because it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
For David speaketh concerning him , I foresaw the Lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved :
And cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet , whose name was Saul .
Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell , neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance .
Men and brethren , let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David , that he is both dead and buried , and his sepulchre is with us unto this day .
When they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed on him with their teeth .
But he , being full of the Holy Ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted ? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One ; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers :
Who have received the law by the disposition of angels , and have not kept it .
Hath not my hand made all these things ?
Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , ye do always resist the Holy Ghost : as your fathers did , so do ye .
It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings , that ye eat neither fat nor blood .
And they tied unto it a lace of blue , to fasten it on high upon the mitre ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
Command the children of Israel , that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them .
This is my commandment , That ye love one another , as I have loved you .
Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father's commandments , and abide in his love .
These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
Ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you .
These things I command you , that ye love one another .
Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever I command you .
Henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you .
If the world hate you , ye know that it hated me before it hated you .
If ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families ; Libni , and Shimei .
And the sons of Kohath by their families ; Amram , and Izehar , Hebron , and Uzziel .
And I , behold , I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel : therefore the Levites shall be mine ;
Because all the firstborn are mine ; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel , both man and beast : mine shall they be : I am the LORD .
And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons , and they shall wait on their priest's office : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD , as he was commanded .
And these were the sons of Levi by their names ; Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari .
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , saying ,
Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers , by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them .
Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die : shall we be consumed with dying ?
But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD , and went down to Joppa ; and he found a ship going to Tarshish : so he paid the fare thereof , and went down into it , to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD .
And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
That ye may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of them that sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and bond , both small and great .
And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him , and to bless in the name of the LORD ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried :
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword , that with it he should smite the nations : and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God .
And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses , clothed in fine linen , white and clean .
And I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ;
And the winepress was trodden without the city , and blood came out of the winepress , even unto the horse bridles , by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
And I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
And I fell at his feet to worship him . And he said unto me , See thou do it not : I am thy fellowservant , and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus : worship God : for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy .
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood : and his name is called The Word of God .
His eyes were as a flame of fire , and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
And they shall answer and say , Our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
See , for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it , lying in the field , and it be not known who hath slain him :
And he beheld them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
He shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . And when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
So they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
Then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
And again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
And again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
And it shall be , that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take an heifer , which hath not been wrought with , and which hath not drawn in the yoke ;
And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos , they came to Perga in Pamphylia : and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem .
Then the deputy , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord .
And now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon thee , and thou shalt be blind , not seeing the sun for a season . And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
And said , O full of all subtilty and all mischief , thou child of the devil , thou enemy of all righteousness , wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ?
The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt , and with an high arm brought he them out of it .

And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them , saying , Ye men and brethren , if ye have any word of exhortation for the people , say on .
But when they departed from Perga , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
Hast thou faith ? have it to thyself before God . Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth .
And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan , he divided their land to them by lot .
It is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weak .
And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment , or in the skin , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a plague of leprosy , and shall be shewed unto the priest :
Whether it be in the warp , or woof ; of linen , or of woollen ; whether in a skin , or in any thing made of skin ;
Then the priest shall look upon it : and , behold , if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head , or in his bald forehead , as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh ;
And if there be in the bald head , or bald forehead , a white reddish sore ; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head , or his bald forehead .
And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is forehead bald : yet is he clean .
And the man whose hair is fallen off his head , he is bald ; yet is he clean .
The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it be a woollen garment , or a linen garment ;
All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled ; he is unclean : he shall dwell alone ; without the camp shall his habitation be .
And the leper in whom the plague is , his clothes shall be rent , and his head bare , and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip , and shall cry , Unclean , unclean .
He is a leprous man , he is unclean : the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean ; his plague is in his head .
This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven , who shall hear report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
Rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Arnon : behold , I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land : begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
Let me pass through thy land : I will go along by the high way , I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left .
And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace , saying ,
A people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims ; but the LORD destroyed them before them ; and they succeeded them , and dwelt in their stead :
( That also was accounted a land of giants : giants dwelt therein in old time ; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims ;
And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim , even unto Azzah , the Caphtorims , which came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
As he did to the children of Esau , which dwelt in Seir , when he destroyed the Horims from before them ; and they succeeded them , and dwelt in their stead even unto this day :
( As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir , and the Moabites which dwell in Ar , did unto me ; ) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us .
Thou shalt sell me meat for money , that I may eat ; and give me water for money , that I may drink : only I will pass through on my feet ;
And he said also unto his disciples , There was a certain rich man , which had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
But he said , Ye are idle , ye are idle : therefore ye say , Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD .
Then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I cannot dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
And he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ?
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? And he said , An hundred measures of wheat . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore .
And he said , An hundred measures of oil . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
And I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations .
And the lord commended the unjust steward , because he had done wisely : for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light .
The LORD will not spare him , but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man , and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him , and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven .
Go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no straw be given you , yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks .
And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case , after it was said , Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task .
In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy , whether he be of thy brethren , or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates :
At his day thou shalt give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor , and setteth his heart upon it : lest he cry against thee unto the LORD , and it be sin unto thee .
Even all nations shall say , Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land ? what meaneth the heat of this great anger ?
Then men shall say , Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark , for the waters were on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth his hand , and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark .
Also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
And God remembered Noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the ark : and God made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters asswaged ;
And the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ;
And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
And the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ararat .
And he sent forth a raven , which went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
And it came to pass at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made :
Which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just ,
And he said , The LORD came from Sinai , and rose up from Seir unto them ; he shined forth from mount Paran , and he came with ten thousands of saints : from his right hand went a fiery law for them .
As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ;
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls :
Who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
Who is weak , and I am not weak ? who is offended , and I burn not ?
Beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
In weariness and painfulness , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
In journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I have been in the deep ;
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one .
Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as a fool ) I am more ; in labours more abundant , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequent , in deaths oft .
Are they Hebrews ? so am I . Are they Israelites ? so am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I .
I speak as concerning reproach , as though we had been weak . Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold , ( I speak foolishly , ) I am bold also .
For ye suffer , if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that Jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
And to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even Jesus , which delivered us from the wrath to come .
Who also hath gone about to profane the temple : whom we took , and would have judged according to our law .
Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison .
And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli ,
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .
Which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Amos , which was the son of Naum , which was the son of Esli , which was the son of Nagge ,
Which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Janna , which was the son of Joseph ,
Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance .
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
Which was the son of Joanna , which was the son of Rhesa , which was the son of Zorobabel , which was the son of Salathiel , which was the son of Neri ,
For God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as in all churches of the saints .
And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spake before Moses , and before the princes , the chief fathers of the children of Israel :
And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel , then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers , and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance .
Which was the son of Maath , which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Semei , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Juda ,
And another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin :
If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father .
They answered and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith unto them , If ye were Abraham's children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
They answered him , We be Abraham's seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ?
As he spake these words , many believed on him .
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him , If ye continue in my word , then are ye my disciples indeed ;
If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
I know that ye are Abraham's seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin .
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever : but the Son abideth ever .
Notwithstanding , that I be not further tedious unto thee , I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words .
Let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
And if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens :
And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
If thou shalt do this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
And let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
And Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
But if any man be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
And Moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
And they judged the people at all seasons : the hard causes they brought unto Moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry .
Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the LORD hath not done all this .
And of Levi he said , Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one , whom thou didst prove at Massah , and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah ;
As for the sons of Merari , thou shalt number them after their families , by the house of their fathers ;
But those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God ; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities : and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people ; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
We who are Jews by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel , I said unto Peter before them all , If thou , being a Jew , livest after the manner of Gentiles , and not as do the Jews , why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews ?
But if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law , but by the faith of Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Jesus Christ , that we might be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the law : for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified .
But when Peter was come to Antioch , I withstood him to the face , because he was to be blamed .
Only they would that we should remember the poor ; the same which I also was forward to do .
And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation .
For before that certain came from James , he did eat with the Gentiles : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them which were of the circumcision .
For I through the law am dead to the law , that I might live unto God .
For if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor .
And the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
And the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about .
And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits , and on the south side two thousand cubits , and on the west side two thousand cubits , and on the north side two thousand cubits and the city shall be in the midst : this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities .
For they are a nation void of counsel , neither is there any understanding in them .
Whither the forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
Peter said unto him , Though I should die with thee , yet will I not deny thee . Likewise also said all the disciples .
Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , That this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .

And whoso shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin , and have omitted the weightier matters of the law , judgment , mercy , and faith : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
And he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
Ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men's bones , and of all uncleanness .
Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous ,
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
And ye said , Behold , the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God doth talk with man , and he liveth .
Now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more , then we shall die .
So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
And when they came to Marah , they could not drink of the waters of Marah , for they were bitter : therefore the name of it was called Marah .
And Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances .
And Miriam answered them , Sing ye to the LORD , for he hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
And said , If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God , and wilt do that which is right in his sight , and wilt give ear to his commandments , and keep all his statutes , I will put none of these diseases upon thee , which I have brought upon the Egyptians : for I am the LORD that healeth thee .
And they came to Elim , where were twelve wells of water , and threescore and ten palm trees : and they encamped there by the waters .
And the people murmured against Moses , saying , What shall we drink ?
And he cried unto the LORD ; and the LORD shewed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet : there he made for them a statute and an ordinance , and there he proved them ,
Go thou near , and hear all that the LORD our God shall say : and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
If she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .

Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations .
And if ye have erred , and not observed all these commandments , which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses ,
Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses , from the day that the LORD commanded Moses , and henceforward among your generations ;
Then it shall be , if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation , that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour unto the LORD , with his meat offering , and his drink offering , according to the manner , and one kid of the goats for a sin offering .
And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD , and their sin offering before the LORD , for their ignorance :
And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignorance .
And if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD , to make an atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them .
And it shall come to pass , that every soul , which will not hear that prophet , shall be destroyed from among the people .
For Moses truly said unto the fathers , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things , which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
And he shall send Jesus Christ , which before was preached unto you :
And it came to pass , that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner .
And it was known throughout all Joppa ; and many believed in the Lord .
And he gave her his hand , and lifted her up , and when he had called the saints and widows , presented her alive .
But Peter put them all forth , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , Tabitha , arise . And she opened her eyes : and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God , in the place which he shall choose to place his name there , the tithe of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks ; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always .
Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ;
In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ :
And to you who are troubled rest with us , when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels ,
Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you ;
Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer :
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure :
We are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ;
Grace unto you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
And he is the head of the body , the church : who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence .
And they took him , and brought him unto Areopagus , saying , May we know what this new doctrine , whereof thou speakest , is ?
Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans , and of the Stoicks , encountered him . And some said , What will this babbler say ? other some , He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods : because he preached unto them Jesus , and the resurrection .
Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews , and with the devout persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was stirred in him , when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry .
And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still .
But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
Therefore many of them believed ; also of honourable women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
These were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of mind , and searched the scriptures daily , whether those things were so .
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea : who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews .
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle .
Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna : Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord .
On the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ;
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .

Fear not , daughter of Sion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass's colt .
And Jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
How that he was caught up into paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
Of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine infirmities .
For though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , the messenger of Satan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted above measure .
And he said , When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them upon the stools ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory . I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago , ( whether in the body , I cannot tell ; or whether out of the body , I cannot tell : God knoweth ; ) such an one caught up to the third heaven .
And I knew such a man , ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I cannot tell : God knoweth ; )
And the king of Egypt called for the midwives , and said unto them , Why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men children alive ?
And the midwives said unto Pharaoh , Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women ; for they are lively , and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them .
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice , that it might depart from me .
And he said unto me , My grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weakness . Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities , that the power of Christ may rest upon me .
But of all clean fowls ye may eat .
Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself : thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates , that he may eat it ; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien : for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God . Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk .
And he said unto him , Son , thou art ever with me , and all that I have is thine .
The nobleman saith unto him , Sir , come down ere my child die .
Then said Jesus unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe .
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee .
And said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world .
And many more believed because of his own word ;
So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .

When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee , whither thou goest to possess them , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their land ;
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation :
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
For indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
For he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick .
Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants .
But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
Him therefore I hope to send presently , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
But ye know the proof of him , that , as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the gospel .
For all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ's .
For I have no man likeminded , who will naturally care for your state .
And the priests , Aaron's sons , shall lay the parts , the head , and the fat , in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water : and the priest shall burn all on the altar , to be a burnt sacrifice , an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD .
And the LORD called unto Moses , and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation , saying ,
Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD , ye shall bring your offering of the cattle , even of the herd , and of the flock .
If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd , let him offer a male without blemish : he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD .
And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him .
And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD : and the priests , Aaron's sons , shall bring the blood , and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
And he shall flay the burnt offering , and cut it into his pieces .
And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar , and lay the wood in order upon the fire :
And he said unto them , These are the words which I spake unto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the law of Moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me .
Then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures ,
And said unto them , Thus it is written , and thus it behoved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day :
And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
And when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet .
And while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , Have ye here any meat ?
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
And he took it , and did eat before them .
And ye are witnesses of these things .
And , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
And he stood between the dead and the living ; and the plague was stayed .
Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
Verily I say unto you , That he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh .
Who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
Watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come .
But know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ;
And shall begin to smite his fellowservants , and to eat and drink with the drunken ;
But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises .
And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better .
Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils .
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of Abraham :
To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all ; first being by interpretation King of righteousness , and after that also King of Salem , which is , King of peace ;
Without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually .
For this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ;
And here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
And as I may so say , Levi also , who receiveth tithes , payed tithes in Abraham .
Wherefore , said they , if we have found grace in thy sight , let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
It is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them ?
And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben , Shall your brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle : and when they saw the land of Jazer , and the land of Gilead , that , behold , the place was a place for cattle ;
Ataroth , and Dibon , and Jazer , and Nimrah , and Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Shebam , and Nebo , and Beon ,
And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb : in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering .

And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , from before the people .
And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering , mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil .

And thou shalt say unto them , This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD ; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day , for a continual burnt offering .

And Jacob did separate the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of Laban ; and he put his own flocks by themselves , and put them not unto Laban's cattle .
And it came to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
And it came to pass in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .

And if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the skin , but it be somewhat dark ; it is a rising of the burning , and the priest shall pronounce him clean : for it is an inflammation of the burning .
Simon , ( whom he also named Peter , ) and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
And when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ;
And it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God .
Then the priest shall look upon it : and , behold , if the hair in the bright spot be turned white , and it be in sight deeper than the skin ; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning : wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the plague of leprosy .

And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
These are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth .

Then released he Barabbas unto them : and when he had scourged Jesus , he delivered him to be crucified .

And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . And he suffered them .

But woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .

But because I have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
Nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .

For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . And they murmured against her .

Who gave himself a ransom for all , to be testified in due time .

Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor : for all the men that followed Baal-peor , the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you .
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you .
Behold , I have taught you statutes and judgments , even as the LORD my God commanded me , that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it .
The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth .
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife ; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife ; and there I buried Leah .
The eyes of your understanding being enlightened ; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling , and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
And the LORD did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
And the table and his furniture , and the pure candlestick with all his furniture , and the altar of incense ,
And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture , and the laver and his foot ,
And I , behold , I have given with him Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ;
And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats , and thou shalt make for them girdles , and bonnets shalt thou make for them , for glory and for beauty .
To devise cunning works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh : and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh .
See , I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah :
And I have filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin , after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the priest again :
Wherefore I also , after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus , and love unto all the saints ,
And the priest shall look on him the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague in his sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skin ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more :
If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turned white ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days :
And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh : and when the hair in the plague is turned white , and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh , it is a plague of leprosy : and the priest shall look on him , and pronounce him unclean .
And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness ; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach :
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron , saying ,
Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of his glory .
Who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations ; according to that which was spoken , So shall thy seed be .
When the plague of leprosy is in a man , then he shall be brought unto the priest ;
And if the priest see that , behold , the scab spreadeth in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a leprosy .
And Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also .
As touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
This is the water of Meribah ; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD , and he was sanctified in them .
Cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ;
How our fathers went down into Egypt , and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyptians vexed us , and our fathers :
And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom , Thus saith thy brother Israel , Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us :
Let us pass , I pray thee , through thy country : we will not pass through the fields , or through the vineyards , neither will we drink of the water of the wells : we will go by the king's highway , we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left , until we have passed thy borders .
Watch ye , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men , be strong .
And the children of Israel said unto him , We will go by the high way : and if I and my cattle drink of thy water , then I will pay for it : I will only , without doing any thing else , go through on my feet .
In whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will :
Now if Timotheus come , see that he may be with you without fear : for he worketh the work of the Lord , as I also do .
That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ , both which are in heaven , and which are on earth ; even in him :
Let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me : for I look for him with the brethren .
In whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise ,
That ye submit yourselves unto such , and to every one that helpeth with us , and laboureth .
That we should be to the praise of his glory , who first trusted in Christ .
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
Let all your things be done with charity .
I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
For they have refreshed my spirit and yours : therefore acknowledge ye them that are such .
And the LORD God said unto the woman , What is this that thou hast done ? And the woman said , The serpent beguiled me , and I did eat .
And the man said , The woman whom thou gavest to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
And he said , Who told thee that thou wast naked ? Hast thou eaten of the tree , whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat ?
The churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
And unto Adam he said , Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife , and hast eaten of the tree , of which I commanded thee , saying , Thou shalt not eat of it : cursed is the ground for thy sake ; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life ;
Unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
And I will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between thy seed and her seed ; it shall bruise thy head , and thou shalt bruise his heel .
And the LORD God said unto the serpent , Because thou hast done this , thou art cursed above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life :
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;
For who is there of all flesh , that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
The tabernacle of the congregation , and the ark of the testimony , and the mercy seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tabernacle ,
And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up :
Some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
And when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprung up , and choked them :
The same day went Jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
And great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
And he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow ;
From thence they removed , and pitched in the valley of Zared .
And Moses said unto them , Stand still , and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you .
But other fell into good ground , and brought forth fruit , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold .
Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness , thou shalt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass .
A land of wheat , and barley , and vines , and fig trees , and pomegranates ; a land of oil olive , and honey ;
I am the God of Bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto me : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred .
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart , that , as a man chasteneth his son , so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee .
Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee , neither did thy foot swell , these forty years .
For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills ;
Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do , that ye may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers .
And he humbled thee , and suffered thee to hunger , and fed thee with manna , which thou knewest not , neither did thy fathers know ; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live .
And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness , to humble thee , and to prove thee , to know what was in thine heart , whether thou wouldest keep his commandments , or no .
And about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle , and saith unto them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ?
They say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . He saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
And said unto them ; Go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right I will give you . And they went their way .
Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
And he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard .
But ye shall destroy their altars , break their images , and cut down their groves :
In the fourteenth day of this month , at even , ye shall keep it in his appointed season : according to all the rites of it , and according to all the ceremonies thereof , shall ye keep it .
When saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
Or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
So when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny .
But we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
For if that which is done away was glorious , much more that which remaineth is glorious .
For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
And not as Moses , which put a vail over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
Seeing then that we have such hope , we use great plainness of speech :
But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the vail is upon their heart .
But their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which vail is done away in Christ .
Now the Lord is that Spirit : and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord , the vail shall be taken away .
Honour thy father and thy mother , as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee ; that thy days may be prolonged , and that it may go well with thee , in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
And Moses said before the LORD , Behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me ?
And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law :
And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven , every stone about the weight of a talent : and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail ; for the plague thereof was exceeding great .
And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree :
A nation of fierce countenance , which shall not regard the person of the old , nor shew favour to the young :
And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle , and the fruit of thy land , until thou be destroyed : which also shall not leave thee either corn , wine , or oil , or the increase of thy kine , or flocks of thy sheep , until he have destroyed thee .
And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates , until thy high and fenced walls come down , wherein thou trustedst , throughout all thy land : and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land , which the LORD thy God hath given thee .
And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the LORD thy God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee :
So that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave :
So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates .
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law .
Is he the God of the Jews only ? is he not also of the Gentiles ? Yes , of the Gentiles also :
To declare , I say , at this time his righteousness : that he might be just , and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus .
Where is boasting then ? It is excluded . By what law ? of works ? Nay : but by the law of faith .
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus :
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God ;
Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
For all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God ;
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin .
But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested , being witnessed by the law and the prophets ;
His body shall not remain all night upon the tree , but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day ; ( for he that is hanged is accursed of God ; ) that thy land be not defiled , which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance .
Now Rachel had taken the images , and put them in the camel's furniture , and sat upon them . And Laban searched all the tent , but found them not .
And she said to her father , Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee ; for the custom of women is upon me . And he searched , but found not the images .
And Jacob was wroth , and chode with Laban : and Jacob answered and said to Laban , What is my trespass ? what is my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursued after me ?
Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff , what hast thou found of all thy household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge betwixt us both .
And now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after thy father's house , yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?
And Jacob answered and said to Laban , Because I was afraid : for I said , Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me .
With whomsoever thou findest thy gods , let him not live : before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me , and take it to thee . For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them .
And Laban went into Jacob's tent , and into Leah's tent , and into the two maidservants' tents ; but he found them not . Then went he out of Leah's tent , and entered into Rachel's tent .
And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ;
This twenty years have I been with thee ; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young , and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten .
That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
And they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ?
And the scripture was fulfilled which saith , Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God .
But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith without works is dead ?
Was not Abraham our father justified by works , when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar ?
And Isaac answered and said unto Esau , Behold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ?
And he said , Is not he rightly named Jacob ? for he hath supplanted me these two times : he took away my birthright ; and , behold , now he hath taken away my blessing . And he said , Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me ?
And he said , Thy brother came with subtilty , and hath taken away thy blessing .
And when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father .
And Isaac trembled very exceedingly , and said , Who ? where is he that hath taken venison , and brought it me , and I have eaten of all before thou camest , and have blessed him ? yea , and he shall be blessed .
And Isaac his father said unto him , Who art thou ? And he said , I am thy son , thy firstborn Esau .
And he also had made savoury meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son's venison , that thy soul may bless me .
And it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
And Isaac his father answered and said unto him , Behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
And Esau said unto his father , Hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , O my father . And Esau lifted up his voice , and wept .
Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
For he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am .
If I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another's feet .
For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
Now I tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room .
When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ;
And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples .
Saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
Sanctify yourselves therefore , and be ye holy : for I am the LORD your God .
And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits , and after wizards , to go a whoring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
And , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy .
And it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying unto them ,
And they could not answer him again to these things .
And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
And they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go ;
And he was sad at that saying , and went away grieved : for he had great possessions .
And Jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
And he answered and said unto him , Master , all these have I observed from my youth .
Then Jesus beholding him loved him , and said unto him , One thing thou lackest : go thy way , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , take up the cross , and follow me .
And they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , Who then can be saved ?
And Jesus looking upon them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible .
And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
Then Peter began to say unto him , Lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
And Jesus answered and said , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel's ,
And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon , distress them not , nor meddle with them : for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession ; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession .
And ye have seen their abominations , and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them : )
( For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt ; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by ;
But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God , and also with him that is not here with us this day :
Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath ;
That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself , and that he may be unto thee a God , as he hath said unto thee , and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God , and into his oath , which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day :
Your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water :
Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God ; your captains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
And it come to pass , when he heareth the words of this curse , that he bless himself in his heart , saying , I shall have peace , though I walk in the imagination of mine heart , to add drunkenness to thirst :
Lest there should be among you man , or woman , or family , or tribe , whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God , to go and serve the gods of these nations ; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood ;
And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD , and uncover the woman's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
And the priest shall charge her by an oath , and say unto the woman , If no man have lain with thee , and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse :
And every man's hallowed things shall be his : whatsoever any man giveth the priest , it shall be his .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man's wife go aside , and commit a trespass against him ,
And a man lie with her carnally , and it be hid from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be defiled , and there be no witness against her , neither she be taken with the manner ;
And the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jealous of his wife , and she be defiled : or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jealous of his wife , and she be not defiled :
Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest , and he shall bring her offering for her , the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal ; he shall pour no oil upon it , nor put frankincense thereon ; for it is an offering of jealousy , an offering of memorial , bringing iniquity to remembrance .
And the priest shall bring her near , and set her before the LORD :
And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water :
That the LORD spake unto me , saying ,
From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them ; all that enter in to perform the service , to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation .
Conscience , I say , not thine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience ?
But if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord's , and the fulness thereof :
Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of devils : ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table , and of the table of devils .
But I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
All things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but all things edify not .
Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? are we stronger than he ?
Whatsoever is sold in the shambles , that eat , asking no question for conscience sake :
Let no man seek his own , but every man another's wealth .
If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
For the earth is the Lord's , and the fulness thereof .
My brethren , count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations ;
If any of you lack wisdom , let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
But let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing .
Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again : but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release ;
And this is the manner of the release : Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the LORD's release .
At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release .
If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart , nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother :
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord .
Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day .
Save when there shall be no poor among you ; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it :
Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart , saying , The seventh year , the year of release , is at hand ; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother , and thou givest him nought ; and he cry unto the LORD against thee , and it be sin unto thee .
But let him ask in faith , nothing wavering . For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed .
Wherefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt separate three cities for thee .
Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters , that shall be an abomination unto you .
And oil for the light , and spices for anointing oil , and for the sweet incense ,
And onyx stones , and stones to be set for the ephod , and for the breastplate .
Thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coasts of thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every slayer may flee thither .
Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it .
When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations , whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their cities , and in their houses ;
And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls ; they shall not be eaten , they are an abomination : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray ,
Six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day , a sabbath of rest to the LORD : whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death .
Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day .
And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together , and said unto them , These are the words which the LORD hath commanded , that ye should do them .
And blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats' hair ,
And rams' skins dyed red , and badgers' skins , and shittim wood ,
And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the LORD commanded , saying ,
Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD : whosoever is of a willing heart , let him bring it , an offering of the LORD ; gold , and silver , and brass ,
They shall be even an abomination unto you ; ye shall not eat of their flesh , but ye shall have their carcases in abomination .

When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
Greatly desiring to see thee , being mindful of thy tears , that I may be filled with joy ;

And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
And God blessed the seventh day , and sanctified it : because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made .

And many of the brethren in the Lord , waxing confident by my bonds , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace , and in all other places ;

What then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .

And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .

But if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white hairs therein , and if it be not lower than the skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
And if , when the priest seeth it , behold , it be in sight lower than the skin , and the hair thereof be turned white ; the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil .

When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
Saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
And if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it :

And if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorcement , and giveth it in her hand , and sendeth her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
And when she is departed out of his house , she may go and be another man's wife .

Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
But now I have written unto you not to keep company , if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator , or covetous , or an idolater , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner ; with such an one no not to eat .
Her former husband , which sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before the LORD : and thou shalt not cause the land to sin , which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance .

But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .

But when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .

Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field :

Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of God .
But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service , and a worldly sanctuary .
For there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary .
And after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all ;
The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing :

Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship , more than those things which were spoken by Paul .
And because the haven was not commodious to winter in , the more part advised to depart thence also , if by any means they might attain to Phenice , and there to winter ; which is an haven of Crete , and lieth toward the south west and north west .
And when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , loosing thence , they sailed close by Crete .

And it came to pass , that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they found none .

Wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .

And upon her forehead was a name written , MYSTERY , BABYLON THE GREAT , THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH .
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus : and when I saw her , I wondered with great admiration .

From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling ;
Desiring to be teachers of the law ; understanding neither what they say , nor whereof they affirm .
But we know that the law is good , if a man use it lawfully ;
Knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you .

When a man hath taken a new wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall he be charged with any business : but he shall be free at home one year , and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken .
Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
That ye may remember , and do all my commandments , and be holy unto your God .
For we are glad , when we are weak , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , even your perfection .
For we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth .
Now I pray to God that ye do no evil ; not that we should appear approved , but that ye should do that which is honest , though we be as reprobates .

But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them ; then he shall bear her iniquity .
These are the statutes , which the LORD commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between the father and his daughter , being yet in her youth in her father's house .
And if she vowed in her husband's house , or bound her soul by a bond with an oath ;
And her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and disallowed her not : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them ; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her soul , shall not stand : her husband hath made them void ; and the LORD shall forgive her .
Every vow , and every binding oath to afflict the soul , her husband may establish it , or her husband may make it void .

Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .

And Moses said , This shall be , when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full ; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him : and what are we ? your murmurings are not against us , but against the LORD .
And when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
And when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
Then were they all of good cheer , and they also took some meat .
And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls .
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
And when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
And while the day was coming on , Paul besought them all to take meat , saying , This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting , having taken nothing .
And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship ,
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , Except these abide in the ship , ye cannot be saved .
All in whose nostrils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died .
And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground , both man , and cattle , and the creeping things , and the fowl of the heaven ; and they were destroyed from the earth : and Noah only remained alive , and they that were with him in the ark .
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains were covered .
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days .
And if a man smite the eye of his servant , or the eye of his maid , that it perish ; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake .
So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , Timotheus and Erastus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
And the same time there arose no small stir about that way .
Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy land , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
But it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
Cursed shalt thou be in the city , and cursed shalt thou be in the field .
Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store .
And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD ; and they shall be afraid of thee .
And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy ground , in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee .
And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red , and a covering above of badgers' skins .
And the LORD shall make thee the head , and not the tail ; and thou shalt be above only , and thou shalt not be beneath ; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God , which I command thee this day , to observe and to do them :
And they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
And Abraham said , My son , God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they went both of them together .
And it came to pass after these things , that God did tempt Abraham , and said unto him , Abraham : and he said , Behold , here I am .
Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah .
And Abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
And he said , Take now thy son , thine only son Isaac , whom thou lovest , and get thee into the land of Moriah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of .
And Abraham said unto his young men , Abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you ,
Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I , my son . And he said , Behold the fire and the wood : but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ?
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
Make thee an ark of gopher wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of : The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
A window shalt thou make to the ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third stories shalt thou make it .
And , behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die .
Then Peter , filled with the Holy Ghost , said unto them , Ye rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man , by what means he is made whole ;
Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed ; and the number of the men was about five thousand .
And it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers , and elders , and scribes ,
And Annas the high priest , and Caiaphas , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at Jerusalem .
And when they had set them in the midst , they asked , By what power , or by what name , have ye done this ?
And as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees , came upon them ,
Being grieved that they taught the people , and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
And they laid hands on them , and put them in hold unto the next day : for it was now eventide .
For which cause we faint not ; but though our outward man perish , yet the inward man is renewed day by day .
For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on :
Neither shall they say , Lo here ! or , lo there ! for , behold , the kingdom of God is within you .
And he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
And they shall say to you , See here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them .
For as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
But first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation .
And as it was in the days of Noe , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
They did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
And they which went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more , Thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul , that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth .
So then death worketh in us , but life in you .
And it came to pass , when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand , when he came down from the mount , that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him .
And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights ; he did neither eat bread , nor drink water . And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant , the ten commandments .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God . Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk .
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning .
We having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , I believed , and therefore have I spoken ; we also believe , and therefore speak ;
Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD , the God of Israel .
And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks , of the firstfruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year's end .
Six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
And of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah ; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On . And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt .
And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him ;
As for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water :
And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water :
This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing : He shall be brought unto the priest :
And the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ;
And Moses called unto Joshua , and said unto him in the sight of all Israel , Be strong and of a good courage : for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them ; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and unto all the elders of Israel .
And the LORD , he it is that doth go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismayed .
And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes , and shave off all his hair , and wash himself in water , that he may be clean : and after that he shall come into the camp , and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days .
But it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
Neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery .
Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; that thy profiting may appear to all .
Take heed unto thyself , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself , and them that hear thee .
For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach , because we trust in the living God , who is the Saviour of all men , specially of those that believe .
These things command and teach .
Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
Till I come , give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine .
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth .
This wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish .
When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace .
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt : therefore I command thee to do this thing .
Or if a soul swear , pronouncing with his lips to do evil , or to do good , whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath , and it be hid from him ; when he knoweth of it , then he shall be guilty in one of these .
And it shall be , when he shall be guilty in one of these things , that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing :
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned , a female from the flock , a lamb or a kid of the goats , for a sin offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin .
And if a soul sin , and hear the voice of swearing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his iniquity .
This is the law of the burnt offering , of the meat offering , and of the sin offering , and of the trespass offering , and of the consecrations , and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings ;
Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron , and of the anointing of his sons , out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office ;
For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings , and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel .
He among the sons of Aaron , that offereth the blood of the peace offerings , and the fat , shall have the right shoulder for his part .
Or if a soul touch any unclean thing , whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast , or a carcase of unclean cattle , or the carcase of unclean creeping things , and if it be hidden from him ; he also shall be unclean , and guilty .
And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar : but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons' .
His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire , the fat with the breast , it shall he bring , that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD .
Or if he touch the uncleanness of man , whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal , and it be hid from him ; when he knoweth of it , then he shall be guilty .
Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD , in the wilderness of Sinai .
Partly , whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , whilst ye became companions of them that were so used .
But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
For we know him that hath said , Vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense , saith the Lord . And again , The Lord shall judge his people .
For ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
Then Peter arose and went with them . When he was come , they brought him into the upper chamber : and all the widows stood by him weeping , and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made , while she was with them .
Wherefore say , Behold , I give unto him my covenant of peace :
And could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel , while he was zealous for my sake among them , that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
Vex the Midianites , and smite them :
Now the name of the Israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites .
And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in Midian .
Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee : the unclean and the clean may eat thereof , as of the roebuck , and as of the hart .
But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
For they vex you with their wiles , wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor , and in the matter of Cozbi , the daughter of a prince of Midian , their sister , which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake .
Only ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water .
Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there ; thither shall ye bring all that I command you ; your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the heave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD :
But when ye go over Jordan , and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit , and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about , so that ye dwell in safety ;
Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest :
And if the priest look , and , behold , the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it ; then he shall rend it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the warp , or out of the woof :
Now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
And she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at Jesus' feet , and heard his word .
Now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flowing with milk and honey ; unto the place of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
And likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him ,
And Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
And by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
And he said , He that shewed mercy on him . Then said Jesus unto him , Go , and do thou likewise .
And went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
And on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay thee .
But Jesus said unto him , Follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead .

Saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
And Abram said , Lord GOD , what wilt thou give me , seeing I go childless , and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus ?
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith ; that ye , being rooted and grounded in love ,
That he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man ;
Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named ,
And when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you , which is your glory .
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him .
According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord :

And to know the love of Christ , which passeth knowledge , that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God .
May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height ;
And God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .

And the evening and the morning were the fifth day .

And God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .

For the heart of this people is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
For this cause therefore have I called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain .

Be it known therefore unto you , that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles , and that they will hear it .
And when he had said these words , the Jews departed , and had great reasoning among themselves .

But I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment , than for you .
And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .

And the one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answering said unto him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days ?
With good will doing service , as to the Lord , and not to men :
Not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but as the servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ;
Servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
And , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed , that the field bringeth forth year by year .
And , ye masters , do the same things unto them , forbearing threatening : knowing that your Master also is in heaven ; neither is there respect of persons with him .
Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receive of the Lord , whether he be bond or free .
And it shall come to pass , while my glory passeth by , that I will put thee in a clift of the rock , and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by :

And he said , Thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see me , and live .
And the LORD said , Behold , there is a place by me , and thou shalt stand upon a rock :
And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation : and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together :

And Israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to Beer-sheba , and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac .
But I say , Have they not heard ? Yes verily , their sound went into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world .
His sons , and his sons' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons' daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
And they took their cattle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt , Jacob , and all his seed with him :
And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba : and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
Then arose Peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved .
For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him .
For the scripture saith , Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed .
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
So then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of God .
But they have not all obeyed the gospel . For Esaias saith , Lord , who hath believed our report ?
And how shall they preach , except they be sent ? as it is written , How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things !
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
It was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles .
And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
And he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
And the officers shall speak unto the people , saying , What man is there that hath built a new house , and hath not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
And he said , Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord : Peradventure there shall be twenty found there . And he said , I will not destroy it for twenty's sake .
And he said unto him , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak : Peradventure there shall thirty be found there . And he said , I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
And the LORD went his way , as soon as he had left communing with Abraham : and Abraham returned unto his place .
And he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak yet but this once : Peradventure ten shall be found there . And he said , I will not destroy it for ten's sake .
And it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
And shall say unto them , Hear , O Israel , ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be ye terrified because of them ;
Doth not even nature itself teach you , that , if a man have long hair , it is a shame unto him ?
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the LORD thy God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue ; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing , and wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in running water , and shall be clean .

And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of Galilee ;
For Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
And he sware unto her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in , and danced , and pleased Herod and them that sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it thee .
And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist .
And she went forth , and said unto her mother , What shall I ask ? And she said , The head of John the Baptist .
And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
And the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath's sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
And when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
And brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
But , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us-ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
Whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished :
But the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
And saying , Where is the promise of his coming ? for since the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation .
For this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water :
That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour :
Knowing this first , that there shall come in the last days scoffers , walking after their own lusts ,
This second epistle , beloved , I now write unto you ; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance :
Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife , She is my sister : and Abimelech king of Gerar sent , and took Sarah .
He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ;
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
Be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God .
Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days :
( For all these abominations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is defiled ; )

For whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life .
And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now .
Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope ,
And not only so , but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received the atonement .
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered .
But if we hope for that we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
For we are saved by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for ?

But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done ,

And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth .
And I will put a division between my people and thy people : to morrow shall this sign be .

Therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .

Who are Israelites ; to whom pertaineth the adoption , and the glory , and the covenants , and the giving of the law , and the service of God , and the promises ;

Against whom when the accusers stood up , they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed :
But had certain questions against him of their own superstition , and of one Jesus , which was dead , whom Paul affirmed to be alive .

Then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , Hast thou appealed unto Caesar ? unto Caesar shalt thou go .
And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus .

But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared ,
Not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to his mercy he saved us , by the washing of regeneration , and renewing of the Holy Ghost ;

That being justified by his grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
And it came to pass about three months after , that it was told Judah , saying , Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot ; and also , behold , she is with child by whoredom . And Judah said , Bring her forth , and let her be burnt .
When she was brought forth , she sent to her father in law , saying , By the man , whose these are , am I with child : and she said , Discern , I pray thee , whose are these , the signet , and bracelets , and staff .

And they said , We cannot , until all the flocks be gathered together , and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth ; then we water the sheep .
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles ; and he did eat and drink , and rose up , and went his way : thus Esau despised his birthright .
And Jacob said , Sell me this day thy birthright .
And Esau said to Jacob , Feed me , I pray thee , with that same red pottage ; for I am faint : therefore was his name called Edom .
And Jacob said , Swear to me this day ; and he sware unto him : and he sold his birthright unto Jacob .
And Esau said , Behold , I am at the point to die : and what profit shall this birthright do to me ?
For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much .
And Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary . So the people were restrained from bringing .

And if it be stolen from him , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .

And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it :
Consider the lilies how they grow : they toil not , they spin not ; and yet I say unto you , that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit ?
Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap ; which neither have storehouse nor barn ; and God feedeth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ?
The life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment .

But the men put forth their hand , and pulled Lot into the house to them , and shut to the door .
And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
And the men said unto Lot , Hast thou here any besides ? son in law , and thy sons , and thy daughters , and whatsoever thou hast in the city , bring them out of this place :
For we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD ; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it .
And Lot went out , and spake unto his sons in law , which married his daughters , and said , Up , get you out of this place ; for the LORD will destroy this city . But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law .
And when the morning arose , then the angels hastened Lot , saying , Arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughters , which are here ; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city .
And while he lingered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the LORD being merciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
And it came to pass , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he said , Escape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed .
And Lot said unto them , Oh , not so , my Lord :
Behold now , thy servant hath found grace in thy sight , and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life ; and I cannot escape to the mountain , lest some evil take me , and I die :
And the priest shall burn the memorial of it , part of the beaten corn thereof , and part of the oil thereof , with all the frankincense thereof : it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD , thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire , even corn beaten out of full ears .
And thou shalt put oil upon it , and lay frankincense thereon : it is a meat offering .
As for the oblation of the firstfruits , ye shall offer them unto the LORD : but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour .
And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt ; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering : with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt .
And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire .
No meat offering , which ye shall bring unto the LORD , shall be made with leaven : for ye shall burn no leaven , nor any honey , in any offering of the LORD made by fire .
And Joktan begat Almodad , and Sheleph , and Hazar-maveth , and Jerah ,
And Hadoram , and Uzal , and Diklah ,
And Arphaxad begat Salah ; and Salah begat Eber .
And unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother's name was Joktan .
The children of Shem ; Elam , and Asshur , and Arphaxad , and Lud , and Aram .
And the children of Aram ; Uz , and Hul , and Gether , and Mash .
These are the sons of Ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their countries , and in their nations .
Unto Shem also , the father of all the children of Eber , the brother of Japheth the elder , even to him were children born .
Which things also we speak , not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
For what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God knoweth no man , but the Spirit of God .
But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .

But if they cannot contain , let them marry : for it is better to marry than to burn .
I say therefore to the unmarried and widows , It is good for them if they abide even as I .
And Jesus went with him ; and much people followed him , and thronged him .
And a certain woman , which had an issue of blood twelve years ,
And had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
When she had heard of Jesus , came in the press behind , and touched his garment .
For she said , If I may touch but his clothes , I shall be whole .
And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me : It is good for a man not to touch a woman .
For I would that all men were even as I myself . But every man hath his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
But I speak this by permission , and not of commandment .
Defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
The wife hath not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body , but the wife .
And when he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into a mountain apart to pray : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
And they that had eaten were about five thousand men , beside women and children .
And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full .
But straightway Jesus spake unto them , saying , Be of good cheer ; it is I ; be not afraid .
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
But the ship was now in the midst of the sea , tossed with waves : for the wind was contrary .
And he said , Come . And when Peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to Jesus .
And Peter answered him and said , Lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee on the water .
Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
The servant therefore fell down , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
But forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which owed him ten thousand talents .
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
Jesus saith unto him , I say not unto thee , Until seven times : but , Until seventy times seven .
Then came Peter to him , and said , Lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? till seven times ?
For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
And his fellowservant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
But the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
Hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
But whoso hath this world's good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him ? Because his own works were evil , and his brother's righteous .
Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people , when ye are come over Jordan ; Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin :
My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
And hereby we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before him .
But that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
For which I am an ambassador in bonds : that therein I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
Peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity . Amen .
And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
But as for thee and thy servants , I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God .
And the flax and the barley was smitten : for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was bolled .
But the wheat and the rie were not smitten : for they were not grown up .
And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image , an abomination unto the LORD , the work of the hands of the craftsman , and putteth it in a secret place . And all the people shall answer and say , Amen .
Who ought to have been here before thee , and object , if they had ought against me .
Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple , neither with multitude , nor with tumult .
And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds , with their knops and their flowers .
Because that thou mayest understand , that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship .
Then Paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me .
And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man , neither raising up the people , neither in the synagogues , nor in the city :
And have hope toward God , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
But this I confess unto thee , that after the way which they call heresy , so worship I the God of my fathers , believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation , and offerings .
And herein do I exercise myself , to have always a conscience void of offence toward God , and toward men .
And when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
Then Paul took the men , and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple , to signify the accomplishment of the days of purifcation , until that an offering should be offered for every one of them .
As touching the Gentiles which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strangled , and from fornication .
Them take , and purify thyself with them , and be at charges with them , that they may shave their heads : and all may know that those things , whereof they were informed concerning thee , are nothing ; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly , and keepest the law .
Do therefore this that we say to thee : We have four men which have a vow on them ;
What is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will hear that thou art come .
And they are informed of thee , that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , saying that they ought not to circumcise their children , neither to walk after the customs .
And when they heard it , they glorified the Lord , and said unto him , Thou seest , brother , how many thousands of Jews there are which believe ; and they are all zealous of the law :
And the tongs thereof , and the snuffdishes thereof , shall be of pure gold .
( For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple . )
Crying out , Men of Israel , help : This is the man , that teacheth all men every where against the people , and the law , and this place : and further brought Greeks also into the temple , and hath polluted this holy place .
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life ; but the wrath of God abideth on him .
The Father loveth the Son , and hath given all things into his hand .
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him .
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true .
And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
He that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
He must increase , but I must decrease .
And to Seth , to him also there was born a son ; and he called his name Enos : then began men to call upon the name of the LORD .
And Adam knew his wife again ; and she bare a son , and called his name Seth : For God , said she , hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel , whom Cain slew .
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold , truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold .
And Lamech said unto his wives , Adah and Zillah , Hear my voice ; ye wives of Lamech , hearken unto my speech : for I have slain a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
And Zillah , she also bare Tubal-cain , an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah .
And his brother's name was Jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
And Adah bare Jabal : he was the father of such as dwell in tents , and of such as have cattle .
And not by his coming only , but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you , when he told us your earnest desire , your mourning , your fervent mind toward me ; so that I rejoiced the more .
And Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
Come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
And it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
And Reuben said unto them , Shed no blood , but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliver him to his father again .
And they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , behold , a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
And they took him , and cast him into a pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
And when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
And when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes .
And they did all eat , and were filled .
And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius , whom I love in the truth .
For I rejoiced greatly , when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walkest in the truth .
Beloved , I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health , even as thy soul prospereth .
Beloved , thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren , and to strangers ;
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth .
But when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out :
And he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not : for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous against them .
And he said unto them , Take me up , and cast me forth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calm unto you : for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you .
The hart , and the roebuck , and the fallow deer , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the wild ox , and the chamois .
Then were the men exceedingly afraid , and said unto him , Why hast thou done this ? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD , because he had told them .
Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah . And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights .
Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly , and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD , and made vows .
So they took up Jonah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ceased from her raging .
Wherefore they cried unto the LORD , and said , We beseech thee , O LORD , we beseech thee , let us not perish for this man's life , and lay not upon us innocent blood : for thou , O LORD , hast done as it pleased thee .
And he washed the inwards and the legs in water ; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar : it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour , and an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
And he cut the ram into pieces ; and Moses burnt the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
And he slew it ; and Moses took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot .
And the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
And he took the fat , and the rump , and all the fat that was upon the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and the right shoulder :
And he brought Aaron's sons , and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear , and upon the thumbs of their right hands , and upon the great toes of their right feet : and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
And he answered him to never a word ; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
And he put all upon Aaron's hands , and upon his sons' hands , and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD .
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
And out of the basket of unleavened bread , that was before the LORD , he took one unleavened cake , and a cake of oiled bread , and one wafer , and put them on the fat , and upon the right shoulder :
Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
For to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace .
But ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God .
And Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said unto him , Thou sayest .
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
Which was the son of Enos , which was the son of Seth , which was the son of Adam , which was the son of God .
Which was the son of Cainan , which was the son of Arphaxad , which was the son of Sem , which was the son of Noe , which was the son of Lamech ,
Which was the son of Mathusala , which was the son of Enoch , which was the son of Jared , which was the son of Maleleel , which was the son of Cainan ,
Which was the son of Jacob , which was the son of Isaac , which was the son of Abraham , which was the son of Thara , which was the son of Nachor ,
Which was the son of Saruch , which was the son of Ragau , which was the son of Phalec , which was the son of Heber , which was the son of Sala ,
Which was the son of Jesse , which was the son of Obed , which was the son of Booz , which was the son of Salmon , which was the son of Naasson ,
But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters , it shall be determined in a lawful assembly .
Which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of Juda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jonan , which was the son of Eliakim ,
Which was the son of Melea , which was the son of Menan , which was the son of Mattatha , which was the son of Nathan , which was the son of David ,
And of Zebulun he said , Rejoice , Zebulun , in thy going out ; and , Issachar , in thy tents .
They shall call the people unto the mountain ; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness : for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas , and of treasures hid in the sand .
Wherefore if Demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
They shall teach Jacob thy judgments , and Israel thy law : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar .
Bless , LORD , his substance , and accept the work of his hands : smite through the loins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again .
And of Benjamin he said , The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him ; and the LORD shall cover him all the day long , and he shall dwell between his shoulders .
And of Joseph he said , Blessed of the LORD be his land , for the precious things of heaven , for the dew , and for the deep that coucheth beneath ,
And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun , and for the precious things put forth by the moon ,
And for the chief things of the ancient mountains , and for the precious things of the lasting hills ,
And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof , and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush : let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph , and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren .
His glory is like the firstling of his bullock , and his horns are like the horns of unicorns : with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth : and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim , and they are the thousands of Manasseh .
( Of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
But in this will we consent unto you : If ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circumcised ;
For as ye in times past have not believed God , yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief :
And these all , having obtained a good report through faith , received not the promise :
And they said unto them , We cannot do this thing , to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; for that were a reproach unto us :
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they were compassed about seven days .
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not , when she had received the spies with peace .
And what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
But Christ as a son over his own house ; whose house are we , if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end .
But if ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus .
But after that faith is come , we are no longer under a schoolmaster .
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
But before faith came , we were kept under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
Is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
Now a mediator is not a mediator of one , but God is one .
Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
Whereunto I also labour , striving according to his working , which worketh in me mightily .
And if ye be Christ's , then are ye Abraham's seed , and heirs according to the promise .
There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in Christ Jesus .
And Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
And he called the name of that place Bethel : but the name of that city was called Luz at the first .
Whom we preach , warning every man , and teaching every man in all wisdom ; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus :
And put fire therein , and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow : and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose , he shall be holy : ye take too much upon you , ye sons of Levi .
And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba , and went toward Haran .
And he lighted upon a certain place , and tarried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pillows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
And he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
They were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented ;
Wherefore ( as the Holy Ghost saith , To day if ye will hear his voice ,
And , behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee , until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of .
And Jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , Surely the LORD is in this place ; and I knew it not .
And he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place ! this is none other but the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven .
And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar , and of the anointing oil , and sprinkle it upon Aaron , and upon his garments , and upon his sons , and upon the garments of his sons with him : and he shall be hallowed , and his garments , and his sons , and his sons' garments with him .
And if men strive together , and one smite another with a stone , or with his fist , and he die not , but keepeth his bed :
And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle , twenty boards on the south side southward .
And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up .
And the LORD said , My spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years .
Two tenons shall there be in one board , set in order one against another : thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
Ten cubits shall be the length of a board , and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board .
And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass , and put the taches into the loops , and couple the tent together , that it may be one .
And you , that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled
And a cubit on the one side , and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent , it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side , to cover it .
That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose .
The Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ?
And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day , and said unto the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day .
And when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
And , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself .
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath .
And he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God .
And when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
If he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
Then said he , Unto what is the kingdom of God like ? and whereunto shall I resemble it ?
Unto whom it was revealed , that not unto themselves , but unto us they did minister the things , which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven ; which things the angels desire to look into .
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you :
Searching what , or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify , when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ , and the glory that should follow .
Because it is written , Be ye holy ; for I am holy .
And if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear :
As obedient children , not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance :
But as he which hath called you is holy , so be ye holy in all manner of conversation ;
Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture , wherewith thou coverest thyself .
If any man take a wife , and go in unto her , and hate her ,
Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things , as silver and gold , from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers ;
But with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot :
And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders , I gave my daughter unto this man to wife , and he hateth her ;
And , lo , he hath given occasions of speech against her , saying , I found not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity . And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
And give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an evil name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a maid :
Then shall the father of the damsel , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate :
And it came to pass on the eighth day , that Moses called Aaron and his sons , and the elders of Israel ;
These are the generations of Noah : Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and Noah walked with God .
And I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
Thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallowed them .
And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it ; it shall not be put out : and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning , and lay the burnt offering in order upon it ; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings .
And thou shalt put it on a blue lace , that it may be upon the mitre ; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be .
And the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
And he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it .
It shall not be baken with leaven . I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire ; it is most holy , as is the sin offering , and as the trespass offering .
And this is the law of the meat offering : the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD , before the altar .
And he shall take of it his handful , of the flour of the meat offering , and of the oil thereof , and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering , and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour , even the memorial of it , unto the LORD .
All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it . It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire : every one that toucheth them shall be holy .
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
And Jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of Caesarea Philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , Whom do men say that I am ?
And he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
For every kind of beasts , and of birds , and of serpents , and of things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed of mankind :
And thou shalt receive them of their hands , and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour before the LORD : it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
And the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity : so is the tongue among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
And he looked up , and said , I see men as trees , walking .
And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee .
And forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
And when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits , and they do obey him .
And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
And they went into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught .
And they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
So then neither is he that planteth any thing , neither he that watereth ; but God that giveth the increase .
I have planted , Apollos watered ; but God gave the increase .
Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom ye believed , even as the Lord gave to every man ?
For while one saith , I am of Paul ; and another , I am of Apollos ; are ye not carnal ?
For ye are yet carnal : for whereas there is among you envying , and strife , and divisions , are ye not carnal , and walk as men ?
I have fed you with milk , and not with meat : for hitherto ye were not able to bear it , neither yet now are ye able .
And I , brethren , could not speak unto you as unto spiritual , but as unto carnal , even as unto babes in Christ .
And fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
The disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
And if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
But the tongue can no man tame ; it is an unruly evil , full of deadly poison .
And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing , and shall add the fifth part thereto , and give it unto the priest : and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering , and it shall be forgiven him .
If a soul commit a trespass , and sin through ignorance , in the holy things of the LORD ; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks , with thy estimation by shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary , for a trespass offering :
And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying ,
But I say unto you , That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
Who being the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high ;
And he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
Do not err , my beloved brethren .
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
But every man is tempted , when he is drawn away of his own lust , and enticed .
Then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .

Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , Intreat the LORD , that he may take away the frogs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD .
And Moses said unto Pharaoh , Glory over me : when shall I intreat for thee , and for thy servants , and for thy people , to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses , that they may remain in the river only ?

And when he met with us at Assos , we took him in , and came to Mitylene .
And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called the elders of the church .
For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .

And Paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , Trouble not yourselves ; for his life is in him .
And we went before to ship , and sailed unto Assos , there intending to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .

And he called it Shebah : therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day .
And he coupled the five curtains one unto another : and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another .
And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling : likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .

Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father , and the lad be not with us ; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life ;
It shall come to pass , when he seeth that the lad is not with us , that he will die : and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave .
For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father , saying , If I bring him not unto thee , then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
Now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .

And this is the Father's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation ; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels .
And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .

Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .

Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God .

And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
Therefore let no man glory in men . For all things are yours ;
And again , The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise , that they are vain .
And ye are Christ's ; and Christ is God's .

But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) Arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
For whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and walk ?
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said , Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
And , behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , This man blasphemeth .

Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby .

For ye know how that afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with tears .
Lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as Esau , who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright .
Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and thereby many be defiled ;
Follow peace with all men , and holiness , without which no man shall see the Lord :
And the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more :
For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , nor unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest ,
Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me ,
Say unto them , As truly as I live , saith the LORD , as ye have spoken in mine ears , so will I do to you :
And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
And a clean person shall take hyssop , and dip it in the water , and sprinkle it upon the tent , and upon all the vessels , and upon the persons that were there , and upon him that touched a bone , or one slain , or one dead , or a grave :
Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers , neither shall any of them that provoked me see it :
Because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ;
But as truly as I live , all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD .

And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
( Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley . ) To morrow turn you , and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea .

Ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
They are of the world : therefore speak they of the world , and the world heareth them .

Beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God .

Beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of God : because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God : Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God :
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
He that loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is love .
In this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .

And , behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river .

Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD .
Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year .
Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread : ( thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days , as I commanded thee , in the time appointed of the month Abib ; for in it thou camest out from Egypt : and none shall appear before me empty : )
Six days thou shalt do thy work , and on the seventh day thou shalt rest : that thine ox and thine ass may rest , and the son of thy handmaid , and the stranger , may be refreshed .

And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and Hoshea the son of Nun .
And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel :
And he said unto them , Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day , which ye shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
For it is not a vain thing for you ; because it is your life : and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land , whither ye go over Jordan to possess it .
For I lift up my hand to heaven , and say , I live for ever .
If I whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .

Rejoice , O ye nations , with his people : for he will avenge the blood of his servants , and will render vengeance to his adversaries , and will be merciful unto his land , and to his people .
Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge , whither he was fled ;
And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge , and the revenger of blood kill the slayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments :
But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb : and if thou redeem him not , then shalt thou break his neck . All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem . And none shall appear before me empty .
But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity , or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait ,
Or with any stone , wherewith a man may die , seeing him not , and cast it upon him , that he die , and was not his enemy , neither sought his harm :
But if he thrust him of hatred , or hurl at him by laying of wait , that he die ;
Or in enmity smite him with his hand , that he die : he that smote him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when he meeteth him .

Every one that passeth among them that are numbered , from twenty years old and above , shall give an offering unto the LORD .
The rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel , when they give an offering unto the LORD , to make an atonement for your souls .
When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number , then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD , when thou numberest them ; that there be no plague among them , when thou numberest them .
This they shall give , every one that passeth among them that are numbered , half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary : ( a shekel is twenty gerahs : ) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD .
For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .

And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years , and bear your whoredoms , until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness .
But love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
Judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful .
And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
And if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
For if ye love them which love you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them .
And he spake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?

And he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
For they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
And Aaron said , Let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischief .
And when Moses saw that the people were naked ; ( for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies : )
And I said unto them , Whosoever hath any gold , let them break it off . So they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf .
And he said unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour .

And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .

The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and findeth Philip , and saith unto him , Follow me .
Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
And Nathanael said unto him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto him , Come and see .

Wherefore , my brethren , ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ ; that ye should be married to another , even to him who is raised from the dead , that we should bring forth fruit unto God .
For when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
But now we are delivered from the law , that being dead wherein we were held ; that we should serve in newness of spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter .
What shall we say then ? Is the law sin ? God forbid . Nay , I had not known sin , but by the law : for I had not known lust , except the law had said , Thou shalt not covet .
Know ye not , brethren , ( for I speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth ?
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth ; but if the husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of her husband .
So then if , while her husband liveth , she be married to another man , she shall be called an adulteress : but if her husband be dead , she is free from that law ; so that she is no adulteress , though she be married to another man .
